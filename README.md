### Abstract:

The potential of AI-based large language models (LLMs) is vast, offering significant opportunities to transform education, research, and various practices. However, as AI-generated text becomes more prevalent, distinguishing it from human-authored content has become a critical challenge.

This article presents a comparative study that introduces a novel dataset featuring human-written and LLM-generated texts across genres, including essays, stories, poetry, and Python code. We employ multiple machine learning models to classify these texts, showcasing their effectiveness in differentiating between human and AI-generated content. Despite the dataset’s limited sample size, the models performed well, although classifying GPT-generated text, particularly in the context of storytelling, proved more difficult.

Our findings reveal that binary classification—distinguishing between human-generated text and a specific LLM—is more straightforward compared to the more complex task of multiclass classification involving human text and multiple LLMs. This research offers valuable insights for AI text detection and lays the groundwork for future studies in this rapidly evolving field.
