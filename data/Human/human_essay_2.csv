Many parents give children a weekly or monthly allowance regardless of their behavior because they believe an allowance teaches children to be ﬁnancially responsible. Other parents only give children an allowance as a reward for completing chores or when they have behaved properly. Explain what you think parents should do and why.,6,"Starting when I was about eight years old, my parents gave me a list of chores that had to be completed each week. If I did my chores, I got an allowance, a bit of change that I could use as I pleased. If I didn’t do my chores, I didn’t get my allowance. There was no other punishment, but no other punishment was necessary. That dollar or two a week was all the incentive I needed to help out around the house. Whether it was the latest Barbie or a six-pack of Hubba Bubba chewing gum, there was always something I wanted to buy. My parents could always count on me doing my chores.I think that giving children an allowance for doing chores is a smart par- enting move, for it accomplishes four important goals: It helps ensure that important work gets done around the house; it teaches children that they need to do their part to make things run smoothly for the whole family; it rewards children in a realistic, practical way for good behavior; and it helps teach children how to handle money.I know that some people consider money for chores a form of bribery, and others feel that children should just do their chores anyway, without the incentive of an allowance. They argue that giving kids money for doing chores undermines the lesson that they need to help the family and do their part. I can understand that point of view, and when parents give their chil- dren too much money, it does undermine those lessons. But when the allowance is small, it is simply a modern version of the age-old practice of rewarding good behavior. Once children reach a certain age, money is an appropriate and effective reward that helps them learn how to be respon- sible and how to manage money. They get a sense of what things are worth and how much they have to save and spend to get what they want. And learning to save in order to purchase a desired item teaches them patience and helps children better understand the value of hard work.Giving children money for doing chores is also a good introduction to the reality of the workplace. If they do the work, they get paid; if they don’t do the work, they don’t. Extra work can be rewarded with bonuses and extra praise; poor work may result in a pay cut or demotion.It’s important for parents to ﬁnd the right amount to give. Too much money may make a child feel like hired help and will undermine the goal of teaching children to help simply because they are part of a family that must work together. On the other hand, too little money may make a child feel resentful, as if his or her work isn’t worth anything to the household. What’s an appropriate amount? It depends upon the amount of chores the child is expected to do and the child’s age. If your nine-year-old is only expected to clean his or her room, a dollar a week is probably plenty. If your fourteen- year-old is expected to keep his room clean, take out the trash, water the plants, and vacuum the house, then ten dollars a week is more appropriate. Being paid for my chores helped me have a good attitude about house- work, taught me how to save money and spend it wisely, and enabled me to appreciate the hard work my parents did around the house. I’m really grate- ful that this was the way my parents chose to handle chores in our household."
Many parents give children a weekly or monthly allowance regardless of their behavior because they believe an allowance teaches children to be ﬁnancially responsible. Other parents only give children an allowance as a reward for completing chores or when they have behaved properly. Explain what you think parents should do and why.,4,"Should parents pay children for doing chores is a good question. My par- ents paid me, and my brothers and sister. I never liked doing chores, but getting an allowance each week (if I did my chores) made it not so bad. In fact, sometimes I did extra (like reorganizing the pantry) to get some extra money for something I really wanted.I think having my allowance depend on my doing chores made me understand what it’s like to work. In the “Real World,” you don’t get paid if you don’t do your work. That’s how it was in our house.I also learned that it’s hard work to keep a house going, I learned to appreciate all the hard work my mom and dad use to do. In addition, I learned how to save money. I would set aside my allowance to save up for something I wanted, like a new CD player or outﬁt.In my opinion, parents should give an allowance for doing chores, but it shouldn’t be too much. Children should know that they need to help no matter what. Too much money I think would make him or her feel like their hired help or something. Contrarily, too little money can make him or her feel like their help isn’t worth anything to his or her parents. So ﬁnding the right amount is important.In conclusion, giving children an allowance for doing household chores is a good idea. Children learn to work for their money and save what they earn."

Chores is hard, on the contrary, there to learn for helping that’s important. For the family. All to do the parts.For me, it was vacuuming and the dusting. Every week, for Saturday or else. Forgetting the allowance, there wasn’t. Only to be punish for what not to do.Children should listen, to their parents. Its very important.22  "
"More and more farmers and food manufacturers are genetically modifying their crops to reduce susceptibility to disease, improve ﬂavor, and reduce costs. Do you think genetically modifying foods is a good idea? Why or why not? Use speciﬁc reasons and examples to support your position.",6,"A few decades ago, manipulating genes in people, plants, and animals was just science ﬁction. Today, it’s a reality, and genetic modiﬁcation may have many positive applications in the future, including the eradication of many hered- itary diseases. But like most scientiﬁc and technological advances, the genetic modiﬁcation of organisms for our food supply can be as dangerous as it is beneﬁcial. Because of the potential dangers of this technology, I think genet- ically altering plants and animals in the food supply is a practice that should be very tightly controlled and carefully studied before it is an accepted and common practice. Unfortunately, it may already be too late for that.Many people don’t even realize that many of their foods are genetically modiﬁed organisms (GMOs). GMOs are already prevalent in supermar- kets and grocery stores across the country, but manufacturers are not required to label foods as having been made from GMOs. As a result, mil- lions of Americans purchase and eat GMOs every day without even know- ing it. Yet we don’t even know if GMOs are harmful to our health. We don’t really know how GMOs may affect our bodies or our ecosystem. When we mess with DNA, we may be making changes that have all sorts of dangerous repercussions, including some that we may not even realize for several generations.One of the main concerns about GMOs is the unpredictability of the behavior of altered genes and of the bacteria, plants, and animals that inter- act with the altered organism. For example, a crop of corn genetically mod- iﬁed to be less susceptible to a particular insect may take on other unwanted characteristics due to the change. It may, for example, become more sus- ceptible to another disease, or it could develop a tougher skin on its kernels, or it could decrease the crop’s ability to produce vitamin E.More frightening is the domino effect of genetically modifying foods. Any change in an organism’s DNA has the potential to affect not only the organism but also anything that feeds off of it, including us. How do we know how GMOs might affect us on a microscopic, genetic level? We don’t know, and can’t know, without years of studies that track all sorts of poten- tial outcomes over several generations.23  Another fear is that transferred genes may escape from one organism into another. For example, imagine that Strain A of sweet peas was altered by adding a gene that would increase its sugar production. Through cross-pol- lination, this altered genetic code could enter other strains and slowly (or quickly) infect the entire sub-species. If the alteration was beneﬁcial, this could be a good thing. But the altered gene might not act the same way in all varieties, and the change may not be a good thing in the ﬁrst place, and/or it may have unintended consequences.Genetically modifying foods is a practice that has been driven by the desire to make more food available more quickly and more cheaply than ever before. This attitude puts proﬁt ﬁrst and consumers and the environ- ment last, and that is simply dangerous. The agribusiness needs to slow down and stop selling us GMOs until their safety is certain."

Do you think genetically modifying foods is a good idea? Why or why not? Use speciﬁc reasons and examples to support your position.",4,"In my opinion GMOs (genetically modiﬁed organisms) are a bad thing. Because we don’t know enough about them, and they could be dangerous, we don’t even know it. There needs to be more studies done before we know for sure its safe.For example, modified genes could jump from one GMO to another GMO. Another problem is we don’t know what other effects a genetic modification might have. If you change a plant to produce more sugar or something that might make its fruit sweeter it might ruin something else in the plant.We eat GMOs even though it may not say so on the label. I’m wor- ried because we don’t know how those GMOs might affect our bodies. Who knows? Technically these are new foods that no human being has ever eaten before. It may be a small change but it’s a change and it could be dangerous.I think there should be a lot of studies to determine the safety of GMOs and I think any food that has GMO in it should have a big “GMO” label on it. We should know what we’re eating and how it might affect us."

No. My idea, its bad. Could be very dangerous. We don’t no, its genes an noone ever did this kind of thing before. What could be the affects? You changing the plant from its foundation. What are the other changes it could be? This is scaring for me.24  I like eating healthy food like soy. These make me feel like I’m putting good in my body. GMOS these make me feel like I’m putting bad in my body. I worry who is the mad scientist."
"A few decades ago, many families had half a dozen or more children. Nowadays, more and more families are choosing to have only one or two children. Are smaller families better than larger ones? Why or why not? State your position and support it with speciﬁc reasons and examples.",6,"I grew up in a large family—I am the oldest of six—and I have many won- derful memories from my childhood. I am very close to most of my siblings and I treasure my relationships with them. But when I have my own fam- ily someday, it won’t be as big as the one I grew up in. As much as my large family was full of love, and as much as I learned about sharing, giving, and patience, I think having too many kids puts too much pressure on the par- ents and the oldest children.When I think back on my childhood, I remember playing with my sib- lings or grandparents. I don’t remember spending a whole lot of time with my mother and father. They were always around, but they were always busy. Although they did their best to spend some quality time with each of us, there was just too much to do to keep our large family going. My mother was always cooking, cleaning, nursing, changing a diaper, shopping, or tak- ing someone to baseball practice or a playdate. She was always tired.My father, on the other hand, was always working. He needed overtime whenever he could get it, and weekends were always full of projects around the house. He had lots of helpers, of course, but there are only so many things kids can do. Even when we were able to get away for vacation, Mom and Dad couldn’t really relax, because there were so many kids to look after. Money was also a constant worry for my family. With so many children, our budget was always tight. Back-to-school shopping was always a stress- ful time; we all wanted the latest fashions, but we could only get a few things. My younger siblings lived on hand-me-downs as much as they could. We shopped at bargain stores and often got clothes that we didn’t really like because they were on sale. Our house always needed repairs, andthere was never enough money to keep up.Another problem with large families is that the older siblings always end up being babysitters. Like it or not (and most of the time I didn’t like it), I25  had to watch my younger brothers and sisters. At age six, I could change a diaper like a pro. I was getting my brothers and sisters dressed, giving them breakfast, helping them get ready for bed. I learned a lot about sharing, self- sacriﬁce, and responsibility at an early age, and these are important char- acter traits that I value highly and want to instill in my children. But I also want to give them a chance to be children. I don’t want them to have so much responsibility at such an early age.I don’t want to give the impression that I didn’t have a happy childhood. I most deﬁnitely did; I was loved as much as my parents could love me, and I had wonderful fun with my brothers and sisters. But I always wanted a lit- tle more time with Mom and Dad, and I often resented having so much responsibility. I wished my mom wasn’t always so tired and my dad didn’t have to work so much. Because I want to be there more for my kids, because I want them to be kids throughout their childhood, I plan to have a much smaller family."

Why or why not? State your position and support it with speciﬁc reasons and examples.",4,"These days, more and more families have only a couple of kids, whereas, a few decades ago, families were much bigger, with sometimes as many as ten kids in the family. I grew up in one of those big families (we have six kids, and I am the oldest). I had a great childhood, but based on my experience and my family’s, I would say that it’s better to have a smaller family.One reason I say this is because I was the oldest, and I sure did a lot of babysitting. My mom was always asking me to watch the kids while she went to the store or took one of the other kids somewhere. I don’t blame her, if I had that many kids I sure would need a helper, too. But lots of times I felt like it wasn’t fair and I didn’t get to do things with my friends because I had to watch my brothers and sisters. I also had to change a lot of diapers, too—and I mean a lot!I also think smaller families are better for another reason: because my mom and dad were always working and tired. I guess if you have a whole lot of money, then it isn’t such a problem. However, we didn’t, and my dad was always working, while my mom was always working around the house or running us around somewhere. I wished I could have spent more time with them, too.I really love my family and especially both of my parents. I did have a great childhood, but I think a smaller family is easier and better, especially for the oldest child.26  "

"Good habits improve our physical, emotional, and/or ﬁnancial health. Select one of your good habits and write an essay persuading readers to make that habit a part of their lives.",6,"When I was ﬁfteen, I wanted to get a job so I could buy a car when I turned sixteen. My father sat me down at the kitchen table and said, “Excellent. But only on one condition: 10% of every paycheck must go into a savings account. And you cannot touch that money except in an emergency.”“But Dad,” I argued, “If I have to put 10% away, how will I ever save enough money to buy a car?”“You’ll have enough,” he replied. “And you’ll soon see how important it is to set money aside for savings.”I didn’t believe him at the time, and in fact I often resented having to put that 10% in a separate account. But two years later when the transmission on my car blew, I didn’t have to fret about coming up with the money for repairs. I was able to cover the cost easily and was back on the road in no time. It was then that I began to see the wisdom of my father’s rule, which I adopted as my own. This habit has helped to give me a secure ﬁnancial life, and I urge you to make this practice part of your life.Ten percent of each paycheck may sound like a lot, and if you’re on a tight budget to begin with, you might be thinking, “I just can’t afford to do it.” In truth, you can’t afford not to do it. You never know when you are going to need an extra $100 or $1,000; life is full of surprises, and lots of them are expensive. You can afford to do this. In fact, you can’t afford not to do this.As tight as your budget may be, it’s important to get started right away. If you are absolutely scraping by with every last penny going to bills, then start with just 5%, but move up to 10% as soon as you can. If you earn $500 a week, for example, put $25–$50 in your savings account each week. At ﬁrst, this may mean clipping coupons, renting a movie instead of going to27  the theater, or pressing your own shirts instead of taking them to the cleaner. Think carefully about ways you can save just a few dollars—because just a few dollars from each paycheck is all it takes to build up a solid sav- ings account.The money you save will add up quickly. For example, if your annual salary is $40,000, each year, you would put $4,000 into your savings account. That still leaves you with $36,000 to cover all of your expenses. After ten years, you will have saved $40,000, plus interest. And the more money in your account, the more interest you earn, the larger your emer- gency fund, the more you can afford to relax later in your life.Once you get in the habit of putting 10% of your money into savings, it won’t feel like a sacriﬁce. The 90% that’s left will be your working budget, and you won’t even miss that 10% because you won’t be used to spending it. Yet you will know that it is there, ready for an emergency, helping to keep you ﬁnancially secure. So take my father’s advice, and mine: Put a piece of each paycheck into your savings. It’s a habit that’s worth every penny."

Whenever I get paid, I put 10% of that check into a savings account. I don’t touch that money except for an emergency or special purchase.I’m really grateful to my dad for helping me start this habit, though I wasn’t at the time, because I wanted to buy a car and I didn’t know how I could save up enough money if I didn’t put it all towards the car, but he was right, I did save enough, and then I had money for repairs because I’d saved carefully. The great thing about this habit is, once you’re in it, you don’t feel like there’s any money missing. You use the 90% to ﬁgure out your budget, notthe 100%. In just one year you can save a whole lot of money.You’re probably thinking, like I did, “I can’t afford to put some of my money away, I need it all.” However, you’re wrong. You can afford it, and you’ll be glad because you’ll always have money for an emergency. So get started today!"

Is there a book that you feel should be required reading for everyone? Write an essay persuading your audience to read this book.,6,"Most people know who Frankenstein is—or at least they think they do. Because of the way Mary Shelley’s brilliant 1818 novel has been adapted to ﬁlm, most Americans think that Frankenstein is a towering, scar-faced mon- ster who brings terror wherever he goes. In Shelley’s novel, however, the real monster is Victor Frankenstein, the scientist who is the monster’s cre- ator. In her story of how Victor Frankenstein creates the monster and what he does after the monster comes to life, Shelley conveys several timeless messages about the dangers of science, the dangers of isolation, and the importance of being a good parent. It is a novel that everyone should read. In the story, Frankenstein, eager for glory, wants to discover the “elixir of life” so that he can have the power to bring the dead back to life. He wants to create a new race of superhuman beings and wants them to wor- ship him like a god. He wants to unlock the secrets of nature and use that power for his own selﬁsh goals. Shelley’s novel warns us that we must be careful what we do with science—how we apply the knowledge we discover. For when Frankenstein does discover the “elixir of life,” and when he does create a superhuman being, he creates a creature that is beyond his control. The creature is more powerful and more intelligent than Victor Franken-stein, and the creature engineers Frankenstein’s demise.Shelley’s novel also warns us about the dangers of isolation. Franken- stein’s creation is so revolting and dangerous in part because Frankenstein works completely alone. He becomes so absorbed with his project that he completely blocks out family and friends. He stops communicating with others and works secretly; he does not consult others about his project, partly because he knows that what he is doing is wrong, partly because he wants all the glory. But because he does not work with others, because he loses touch with his community of family and friends, he also loses touch with his responsibility to other human beings. When the creature comes to life, Frankenstein runs away, abandoning his creation even though he knows the creature might harm others.29  This abandonment brings us to the novel’s third timeless message: the importance of being a good parent. Frankenstein creates a living being and then abandons him because he is an “ugly wretch.” He totally ignores his responsibility to the creature, who is born as innocent as a child, even though he is the size of a giant. The creature is abhorred by everyone he meets, and because no one has ever shown him love, he learns to hate. And the person he comes to hate most is the father who abandoned him. Shel- ley’s message is clear: you are responsible for what you create, and if you are a parent, you must love your child, whatever his or her appearance.In our age of cloning and genetic engineering, of scattered communities and neighbors who don’t know each other’s names, of abandoned children and abusive parents, Shelley’s book may have more importance than ever. It is also a powerful and suspense-ﬁlled tale. Will Frankenstein capture the creature? Will he create a “bride” for the monster? Will Walton, the ship captain who records Frankenstein’s story, learn from Frankenstein’s tale? Find out for yourself. Grab a copy of this amazing novel and enjoy."
Is there a book that you feel should be required reading for everyone? Write an essay persuading your audience to read this book.,4,"Frankenstein isn’t who most people think he is, which is the monster. The real Frankenstein is the scientist who brings the monster to life. You’d know this if you read one of the greatest novels ever written, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, a book that I think everyone should read. This book is great because its suspensefull and teaches some important lessons, these lessons are maybe even more important to day than they were in Shelly’s time. (Which was the 1800s.)One lesson is about how to use science. Dr. Frankenstein in the story dis- covers how to bring a dead person back to life. But everything goes wrong after the creature wakes up. What was supposed to be a great thing that would bring Frankenstein all kinds of glory and make him like a master cre- ator instead brought him and lots of other people all kinds of terrible hor- ror. I think Mary is telling us to be very careful how we use science.She also is telling us in this story to stay close to others. Frankenstein makes the creature all by himself. While he’s working on the monster; he doesn’t talk to anyone, no one in the university knows what on earth he’s up to, he’s got a big secret. He’s so obsessed and he forgets to think about what will happen once this giant creature comes to life. He doesn’t think about being responsi- ble to and for the creature. Because he worked alone he forgot about that.The third lesson is that we need to be good parents. Frankenstein is like the creature’s father and mother. He created him, and he needs to take care30  of him. But he doesn’t, he just runs away. That’s when his horror begins, and the creature’s, too. The poor creature is hated by everyone and his life is really sad.Read this excellent book!"

Some people think of the United States as a nation of “couch potatoes.” Write an essay persuading readers to be more physically active.,6,"Is your favorite place in the home sitting on the couch in front of the tele- vision? Do you spend hours and hours there each day, surrounded by bags of chips and cans of soda? Do you panic when you can’t ﬁnd the remote control and think that you might actually have to get up off of the sofa to change the channel?If you answered “yes” to any of these questions, you are not alone. In fact, you are one of the millions of Americans who are “couch potatoes”: peo- ple who spend their days and nights “vegging out” in front of the “tube.”Well, spud, it’s time to get up out of that armchair and get some exercise! I know how seductive television can be. I know how easy it is to plop onto the sofa and lose yourself in the world of sports, reality shows, and good- old make-believe. I know how mesmerizing MTV and other channels can be and how hard it can be to pull yourself away. But all that television spells disaster for your body because it needs to be active to be healthy. And it’sno good for your mental health or social life, either.Think about what all that time in front of the television is doing to your body. Think about what all that sagging muscle and growing belly is doing to your life. Think about how your lack of energy affects you at work.Now think about how different things would be if you spent some of that31  TV time getting exercise instead: You would feel better during the day. You would sleep better at night. You would have more energy. You would look better. You would have more conﬁdence. You would be more creative. You would be healthier and happier. And you would not even miss the television. What sort of exercise can you do? Anything! Go for a walk. Ride a bike.Jog. Lift weights. Take an aerobics class. Do yoga. Join a basketball or hockey league. Swim. Roller blade. Grab a friend, a fellow couch potato, and exercise together.You can start with just ﬁfteen minutes a day, two or three days a week, and build up slowly. Before you know it, your couch potato days will be over, and you will wonder how on earth you ever spent so much time in front of the TV."

They spend so much time on the couch they’re almost becoming part of the couch. They don’t ever want to get up to change the channel, so the remote control is like a part of their hand. Is that what you’re like? Do you spend too much time in front of the TV? Well, it’s time to stop being a couch potato. You need to take care of your body. It’s time for you to get up and get some excercise.If you lay around all day, think of how that’s just not good for you. It’s not healthy. You need to get excercise to be healthy. Physical activity at least three times a week will get you back in shape. It will help you have a healthy heart, better sleep, and less likely to get sick and diseases because your immune system will be stronger. Furthermore, you’ll have more energy and just feel better. This is especially good for you at work. In addition, you’ll be more conﬁdent because you will look better and ﬁt into nicer clothes. When you feel better about yourself, you’re happier.Its easy to get excercise. You can do some jumping jacks or jog or play tennis. Even just walking to the store instead of driving can help. Maybe you could join a gym or a sports team, like a basketball team in your neigh- borhood. Or ask a friend whose also a couch potato to excercise with you. Its easier when you have someone to excercise with.So do yourself a favor, stop spending so much time in front of the TV!You’ll be proud when your days as a couch potato are over."

"Nowadays, the private life of a politician is hardly private. In your opinion, should we be so concerned with the private affairs of a politician or political candidate? State your position and support it with speciﬁc reasons and examples.",6,"When you think of former president Bill Clinton, what’s the ﬁrst thing that comes to mind? Unfortunately, for many people, the ﬁrst thing they think of is Monica Lewinsky. Like millions of people around the globe, I was hor- riﬁed by how much the investigation delved into Mr. Clinton’s private affairs. No one needed to know the sort of details that were revealed by Ken Starr’s investigation. But while I don’t want to know the details, I do believe we have a right to know what sort of lives our politicians are living. I believe their behavior in private is a reﬂection of their true values and how they will behave in ofﬁce.For example, if a politician lies to his or her spouse (I’m talking about big lies, like inﬁdelity, not little white lies), that tells us something about his or her character. In my opinion, this person is not to be trusted. I wouldn’t have faith that this politician would keep his or her word. True, the rela- tionship between a husband and wife is very different from that between a politician and his or her constituents. But the politician’s respect for that relationship and how he or she deals with any problems in that relationship reﬂects his or her level of integrity.Similarly, if a politician (or political candidate) behaves in an illegal man- ner, that shows a disrespect for the law. A government ofﬁcial who employs an illegal resident as a nanny or housekeeper, for example, or pays a nanny or housekeeper under the table to avoid taxes is acting as if he or she is above the law—or demonstrating that he or she simply doesn’t care about the law. This is not the kind of person I want in a public ofﬁce.On the other hand, if a politician leads a respectable, law-abiding life at home, we can expect a respectable, law-abiding performance in ofﬁce. A politician who deals honestly with family, friends, and business associates is likely to deal honestly with his or her constituents as well. A politician who33  respects the law in all aspects of his or her private life is likely to respect the law while in ofﬁce, too. A candidate who behaves in a cautious, reserved manner regarding his or her personal affairs is likely to bring a similar approach to the ofﬁce.I know that nobody is perfect and that every politician may have skele- tons in the closet. I’m not talking about transgressions from the distant past. But I am concerned with a politician’s recent past and current behavior. Is he or she honest or does he or she break promises? Does he or she behave recklessly or in a thoughtful and controlled manner? We cannot separate who we are personally from who we are professionally. That is why I believe the public has a right to know."
"Nowadays, the private life of a politician is hardly private. In your opinion, should we be so concerned with the private affairs of a politician or political candidate? State your position and support it with speciﬁc reasons and examples.",4,"Politicians live very public lives. If their big politicians (like the president, for example), they don’t really have any privacy. Everybody knows every- thing they do. This probably bothers some people, however, I actually think that is a very good thing. I think we need to know what politicians are really like. How they are at home (in private) tells us about how they will be in the ofﬁce.It’s true that we are different at home and in the ofﬁce. However, we’re still the same person. In other words, we will pretty much act the same, on the same values and principals, whether we’re at home or in the ofﬁce. If we would steal or lie at home, we would probably steal or lie in the ofﬁce. So, if a politician lies to his wife, for example, or to her business partners, then we can probably expect them to lie to the people who elected them.On the contrary, if a politician lives an honest life and always obeys the law. We can probably expect them to behave honestly and lawfully when they are in ofﬁce. Because like I started to say before, you can’t separate home and work. We’re the same person in both places.So, in conclusion, it’s a good idea to have knowledge about politician’s private affairs. They probably don’t like it and want things to be private. However, since they are our elected ofﬁcials, they have to be public, unfor- tunately for them about almost everything."

State your position and support it with speciﬁc reasons and examples.",1,"The politicians, they have privacy in there homes. For them too much is knowed about everything what they is doing. This is bad; for them. Whereas, knowing the public are a very good thing for us. If lying and steal- ing there, also here. Don’t you agree? It is clear. If they are a liar at home,34  we will be lying to also. So therefore, in my opinion, “we should be so con- cerned with the private affairs of a politician or political candidate.”"
Today’s top professional athletes often have salaries and bonuses in the tens of millions of dollars. Do you think these athletes deserve such high compensation? Why or why not? Explain your position and use speciﬁc reasons and examples.,6,"When he was at the height of his basketball career, Michael Jordan was making approximately $300,000 per game. That’s more than most people make in a year; indeed, it’s more than some people earn in a lifetime. Yes, Michael Jordan was a phenomenal basketball player. Yes, he was also a fan- tastic role model. But no, he did not deserve to earn such a ridiculously high salary. Jordan, like many other top professional athletes, was grossly over- paid.Why do top athletes earn such inﬂated salaries? Because they bring big bucks into their cities and franchises. But what sort of service do they pro- vide to society? Do they save lives? No. Do they improve the standard of living or promote positive social change? No. Do they help keep our streets safe or educate our kids? No. True, many of the top athletes are good role models for our children. But seven-ﬁgure salaries don’t always mean model behavior. Take N.B.A. star Latrell Spreewell, for example, who choked and threatened to kill his coach.It is true that professional athletes work hard, and many have spent their lives pursuing their goals. It is also true that most professional athletes have a relatively short career span—a decade perhaps at the top of their game. Limited as their professional sporting career may be, they don’t deserve such high salaries. After their professional sports careers are over, they can certainly pursue other careers and work “regular” jobs like the rest of us. Ending their stint as professional athletes doesn’t mean they have to stop earning incomes. They just have to earn incomes in a different way. Why should they be any different from the rest of us who may need to switch careers?It is also true that professional athletes may be injured while on the job; their work is indeed physical, and especially in contact sports like football, injuries are bound to happen. But, like the rest of us, they have insurance, and in nearly all cases, their exorbitant salaries more than cover their med- ical costs. And theirs is not the only high-risk job. What about miners, con-35  struction workers, or ﬁreﬁghters? They are at risk for physical injury every day, too—injuries that could likewise end their careers. But they sure aren’t earning millions of dollars a year.It is also true that professional athletes may spend years and years prac- ticing with farm teams for a fraction of the salary they receive once they make it to the top. But in every career path, we start off with lower wages and must pay our dues and work our way up. Besides, farm team salaries are not always so low.We’re a sports-crazy country, a nation of fanatic sports fans and celebrity worshippers. We’re awed and entertained by the best of them—the Michael Jordans, the Alex Rodriguezes, the Emmitt Smiths. But as much as they may inspire and amuse us, professional athletes do not deserve such high salaries. Those millions could be much more wisely spent."

Explain your position and use speciﬁc reasons and examples.,4,"Do athletes get paid too much? You bet. That’s my opinion.Professional athletes, what do they do with all that money? Imagine Michael Jordan earning $300,000 per game! Plus all his money from Nike and other advertising. I think that money can be put to much better use in this country.Professional athletes should get good salaries, but not the millions like they get now. It’s just too much. Their job isn’t dangerous, except maybe for football or ice hockey where it’s easy to get a bad injury. It’s easy to get a bad injury in lots of other jobs, too, like construction, but they don’t get millions of dollars. I guess, the difference is that nobody likes to watch construction workers. There’s fun in the game and people like the competition, sports teams bring lots of money into a city’s economy.If professional athletes could guarantee they’d also be a good role model for kids, then maybe they could have such high salaries. Because they’d be doing something good for society since so many kids are watching. For now though, it’s too much."

Is reading ﬁction a waste of time? Why or why not? Explain your answer using speciﬁc reasons and examples to support your position.,6,"Remember the last book that captured your imagination, that transported you to another place and time? Remember a book that made you fall in love with its characters, made you feel their pain and joy? Remember a story that taught you an important lesson, that helped you better understand others, make sense of the human condition? If so, then you can understand why the question, “Is reading ﬁction a waste of time?” is such a silly question.Fiction, unlike a user manual, a magazine article, or newspaper editorial, probably won’t offer you any practical knowledge that you can put to imme- diate use. It won’t inform you of current events or give you advice on how to cultivate a better garden. It probably won’t help you decide which can- didate to vote for or which product to buy. But that certainly doesn’t mean it’s useless or impractical. Indeed, ﬁction serves three important functions for human beings: It helps us be more compassionate to others, it helps us better understand ourselves, and it cultivates our imaginations. It can also teach us about history, psychology, even biology and other sciences.Compassion for others is rooted in understanding and acceptance, and a good story brings us into the inner world of its characters so that we can understand them. In Toni Morrison’s novel The Bluest Eye, for example, Morrison peels away the layers of her characters’ histories piece by piece like an onion until we see into their core and understand what drives them. They may still do awful things to each other, but she shows us why they do the things that they do, and we learn that we shouldn’t judge others until we understand their pasts. Their stories are sad and painful, and we learn to love even the outcast Pecola. In fact, we learn that those outcasts are the ones who need our love the most.Many stories and novels also help us better understand ourselves. Joseph Conrad’s dark and powerful novel Heart of Darkness helps us see that all of us have a dark side, and that we need to acknowledge this dark side in order to control it. It makes us question just how civilized we are and indeed what it means to be civilized in the ﬁrst place.Good ﬁction also cultivates our imagination, which is more important to us than some might think. Without imagination, we live a sad, empty life. Imagination is central to our emotional health and is a key factor in our level of intelligence. Facts are one thing; but facts can be of no real use unless coupled with imagination. Fiction can help us by keeping our imag-37  ination fresh and active. In a story like Franz Kafka’s “Metamorphosis,” for example, we are asked to imagine that Gregor, the main character, wakes up one morning and has turned into a giant bug. Crazy? Perhaps. But once we accept this premise and imagine Gregor as a ﬁve-foot long cockroach, we can feel his family’s horror and imagine his agony as he ﬁnds himself trapped in his room and abandoned by those he loves.Is reading ﬁction a waste of time? That’s like asking if laughing is a waste of time. We don’t need ﬁction to survive, but we do need it to be kinder, more understanding, and more creative human beings."
Is reading ﬁction a waste of time? Why or why not? Explain your answer using speciﬁc reasons and examples to support your position.,4,"Is reading ﬁction a waste of time? I am surprised by this question. I never thought of it as a waste of time. I understand that it is not practical like read- ing a “how-to” article or something like that. However, on the other hand, it is good for you. I think it helps you have a good imagination and be a bet- ter person.I think ﬁction helps you be a better person because it helps you under- stand people. Lots of stories help you understand why people do what they do. For example, in The Bluest Eye, at the end of the story we understand why the people do the things that they do. We judge the characters right away but then we learn about them and maybe change our judgment. The book was written by Toni Morrison.Second, I think ﬁction also helps you understand yourself. Some stories help us see that we all have a good side and a dark side within. Fiction can also help us have a good imagination, and this is important in helping us be creative. Being creative can help you better solve problems and think of original things.I love reading ﬁction, and I never think it is a waste of time. It may not be practical, like reading the newspaper, however it is a lot more fun and helps me be a better person."

Some people think that school cafeterias should be required to provide low-fat and/or vegetarian lunch options to accom- modate the eating habits of all students. Do you agree or disagree? Explain your position and use specific reasons and examples as support.,6,"It’s a fact: There are students across the United States who are vegetar- ian and/or health conscious, and school cafeterias should be required to provide low-fat and/or vegetarian lunch options for them. Even more importantly, many teenagers’ dietary decisions are not only based on health concerns but also religious and/or moral issues. In this day and age, an individual's eating habits often reﬂect his or her identity. For these rea- sons, it's imperative that each school's cafeteria menu be as diverse as its student body.Just by reading headlines in any of the major news magazines, it becomes clear that the United States is a nation that needs to slim down. In every town and city, there are an abundance of fast food restaurants that lure teenage customers with fast, inexpensive, and tasty food, but these foods are typically unhealthy. Unfortunately, school cafeterias, in an effort to provide food that is appetizing to young people, mimic fast food menus, often serv- ing items such as burgers and fries, pizza, hot dogs, and fried chicken. While these foods do provide some nutritional value, they are relatively high in fat, and many of them, namely burgers, hot dogs, and fried chicken, are clearly not designed for vegetarians.Many of the lunch selections currently offered by most school cafeterias could be made vegetarian and/or more healthy with a few simple and inex- pensive substitutions. Veggie burgers, for example, offered alongside beef burgers, would give both vegetarians and the health conscious more options. A salad bar woud also serve the dual purpose of providing both veg- etarians and low-fat food eaters the opportunity for a satisfying meal. This is not to say that accommodating every desire or food preference is plausi- ble, but students should have the right to be served foods that coincide with their life choices."

Explain your position and use specific reasons and examples as support.,4,"In the United States there are many people who are vegetarian. In addi- tion, there are people who choose to eat low-fat foods, either to lose weight or to stay healthy. Many of these people are students who eat lunch at their39  school cafeterias on a daily basis. Surprisingly though, school cafeterias are not required to provide low-fat nor vegetarian options for students.Unfortunately, vegetarian options may be limited to the french fries (served with burgers) or pizza. While these are vegetarian (non-meat) options, they do not necesarily serve as low-fat foods. I think schools should have a wider variety of low-fat and/or vegetarian options such as a salad bar, or perhaps even something with tofu.While cafeterias can't meet all the demands of students, it is important to offer those commited to a healthy or vegetarian lifestyle the choice. Schools should create a menu that offers these options for all students."

"Many people feel that the use of surveillance cameras in public places such as parking lots is a good idea that can help ensure our safety. Others worry that too many cameras violate our right to privacy and give law enforcement ofﬁcials too much power. In your opinion, should we install more surveillance cameras in public places? Why or why not? Support your position with speciﬁc reasons and examples.",6,"Not long ago, the nation was gripped by the horrifying news that a baby had been stolen from a car in a parking lot while her mother, who was return- ing a shopping cart, was just a few feet away. Thanks to the description of the kidnapper captured by surveillance cameras in the parking lot and broadcast over radios, television, and highway overpass signs, the kidnap- per was quickly caught and the baby returned, unharmed, to her mother. Had it not been for those surveillance cameras, that mother would proba- bly never have seen her baby girl again.I can’t think of a much better argument for the use of surveillance cam- eras in public places. That baby’s life was saved by those parking lot cameras. Many people worry about the use of surveillance cameras in public places such as parking lots, stores, parks, and roadways. They don’t like the idea that they are being watched. They worry that the information captured on40  the surveillance tapes can somehow be used against them. But how? It seems to me that the only reason we should worry about being caught on surveillance cameras is if we are doing something wrong. If we are behav- ing lawfully in a public place, then why worry if it is captured on ﬁlm?Surveillance cameras can provide two immensely important services. One, they can help us ﬁnd those who commit crimes, including thieves, kid- nappers, vandalizers, and even murderers. Two, they can serve as a power- ful deterrent to crime. A thief who plans to steal a car may think twice if he knows he will be caught on video. A woman who hopes to kidnap a child may abandon her plans if she knows she will be captured on ﬁlm.Surveillance cameras can also help us in less critical but nonetheless prac- tical ways. In some towns in England, for example, radio deejays use infor- mation from surveillance cameras to announce the availability of parking spaces in crowded public parking lots. Problems of all shapes and sizes can also be noted and addressed through video surveillance. For example, imagine a video camera installed in a local town square. Reviewing the ﬁlms, ofﬁcials might realize that people who meet in the square move quickly into the shade of the one tree in the center of the square. This could move ofﬁcials to plant more trees or provide tables with umbrellas so that people could meet and relax in the shade. Similarly, a video camera in a grocery store might reveal that Isle 7 is always overcrowded, prompting the manager to re-arrange items to more evenly distribute shoppers.Of course it’s possible to have too much of a good thing, and if surveil- lance cameras cross the line and start being installed on private property— that is, in our ofﬁces and homes—then we will have the “Big Brother is watching” scenario opponents fear. If that were the case, I would be against surveillance cameras, too. But as long as surveillance cameras are limited to public places, they can help ensure our safety."

I think this is a good idea, and that more places should have them.Surveillance cameras are a good thing because they help keep us safe. If people know they might be on video then, they probably won’t do some- thing bad or against the law, like stealing. This is a big protection for us. It makes me feel safer, especially like in a parking lot in the night time. The other good thing about surveillance cameras, is that they can help us catch someone who does do something bad. For example, stealing a car in a park-41  ing lot. The camera can get a good picture of the thief and the police will have a good description of the person who stole the car. That makes it a lot easier to catch the thief.I think surveillance cameras can also be used for other good things, like helping ﬁx trafﬁc jams in grocery stores. I mean if you can see that people are always crowding in one isle, for example.I know that some people are upset about this kind of thing (being on ﬁlm) and think that it’s like “Big Brother is watching,” or something. Also, some people just don’t like being on cameras. However, if you’re not doing any- thing wrong, it shouldn’t matter. Their only for ﬁnding people who do things wrong. To me, I think that makes a lot of sense."

"Alexander Smith said, “The great man is the man who does a thing for the ﬁrst time.” Do you agree with this deﬁnition of greatness? Why or why not?",6,"Just as there are many deﬁnitions of success, there are also many deﬁnitions of greatness. Alexander Smith said that a great person is someone who does a thing for the ﬁrst time. He’s right, and the list of those great people is long and includes the likes of Neil Armstrong, Jackie Robinson, and Thomas Edison. But Smith’s deﬁnition isn’t broad enough to include many other people who I believe are also great. In my opinion, greatness can also be attained by doing something to improve the lives of others.Mother Teresa is the ﬁrst person to come to mind under this broadened deﬁnition. Mother Teresa, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, dedicated her life to helping the poor, the sick, and the hungry. She left her homeland of Yugoslavia to work with the impoverished people of India, where she selﬂessly served others for almost 70 years. She became a nun and founded the Missionaries of Charity sisterhood and the House for the Dying. She embraced those that many in society chose to disdain and ignore: the crippled and diseased, the homeless and helpless. She gave them food, shelter, medical care, and the compassion that so many others denied42  them. She was certainly not the ﬁrst to dedicate her life to the care of oth- ers, but she was certainly a great woman.Another great person who also won a Nobel Peace Prize was Dr. Albert Schweitzer, a German doctor who, like Mother Teresa, also selﬂessly served the poor and sick. Schweitzer dedicated himself to the people of Africa. There, he built a hospital and a leper colony, a refuge for those who had been rejected by society. Again, he was not the ﬁrst to offer care and com- fort for the sick and suffering. But he certainly was great.Harriet Tubman is also clearly a great woman. She led hundreds of Amer- ican slaves to freedom along the underground railroad, risking her life over and over again to bring her fellow slaves to freedom. She gave them the greatest gift one can offer: freedom to live a better way of life. She wasn’t the ﬁrst to escape, and she wasn’t the ﬁrst to go back for others. But she was the one who kept going back. She knew that each time she returned for another, she was risking her life. But like Mother Teresa and Dr. Schweitzer, Harriet Tubman was utterly dedicated to improving the life of others.Greatness comes in many forms, and we are lucky to have many exam- ples of greatness upon which to model our lives. Some great people are those who were able to be the ﬁrst to accomplish something marvelous. Others, like Mother Teresa, Albert Schweitzer, and Harriet Tubman, are great because they worked tirelessly to ease the suffering of their fellow human beings."
"Alexander Smith said, “The great man is the man who does a thing for the ﬁrst time.” Do you agree with this deﬁnition of greatness? Why or why not?",4,"According to Alexander Smith, “The great man is the man who does a thing for the ﬁrst time.” In my opinion, this is a good deﬁnition, but it is also too narrow. By that I mean that it is not broad enough to include lots of other people that I believe are great. There are many people who didn’t neces- sarily do anything for the ﬁrst time who have done great things.One example was Mother Teresa. Another is Albert Schweitzer, and a third is Harriet Tubman.Albert Schweitzer opened up a hospital and leper colony in Africa to take care of the sick and abandoned people who had no money or access to health care. This was a great thing. Without his hospital, people would die or suffer and be outcast by society.Harriet Tubman is famous for being a woman who kept going back to the South to free slaves. She led them through the “underground railroad” and brought them to freedom. She wasn’t the ﬁrst to escape or help others escape, but she was great because she kept doing it and kept helping others.43  Finally, Mother Teresa helped so many people. She went to India and opened up a place for the sick and the dying to be taken care of. She helped to feed and comfort hungry and sick people, thousands of them. She is what it means, to be compassionate towards others.All three of these people and lots of others like them are great for what they did to help others."
"Alexander Smith said, “The great man is the man who does a thing for the ﬁrst time.” Do you agree with this deﬁnition of greatness? Why or why not?",1,"What does it mean, to be great. Alexander Smith say that “The great man is the man who does a thing for the ﬁrst time.” I know a lot of great men, the list can be long: George Washington, Robert Kennedy, Mother Teresa, Har- riet Tubman, Beethoven, Jackie Robinson, Reggie Jackson (I like baseball), Martin Luther King, and etc. the list goes on and on.To be great is not an easy thing. Having to do something for the ﬁrst time, or doing something else that is great. You can be leading others or helping them. In fact not everyone who does this is great."
Should people lease or buy new cars? Make a case for the option that you think is best. Use speciﬁc reasons and examples to support your position.,6,"Planning to lease a car because you don’t think you can afford to buy? Think again. Leasing can end up being just as expensive as buying—and you don’t even get to keep the car. Even if you decide to buy the car at the end of your lease, you may end up paying considerably more money than if you’d decided to buy from the beginning.Most people who are thinking about leasing are attracted to this option because they believe it will cost them less money. And they’re right—it is cheaper, but only in the short term. For example, if you were to lease a 2002 Subaru Forester, with $2,500 down, you might pay $250 per month for the car. If you were to buy the same car, with $2,500 down, you would pay closer to $350 per month. Over a three-year lease, that’s $3,600—a big sav- ings. But after your lease is over, you have to give the car back. If you want to keep driving, you’ll either have to put another down-payment on another lease, or, if you have the option to buy the car, you’ll have to pay thousands of dollars to purchase the vehicle—dollars that won’t be spread out in more manageable monthly payments.Many people want to lease because they can then drive a nicer car than44  they might otherwise be able to afford. For example, if your monthly budget allowed you to spend $250 on your car, you might be able to lease a brand new Ford Explorer. For the same price, you might have to buy an Explorer that was two or three years old with 50,000 miles, or buy a new but considerably less expensive make and model. A lease therefore allows you to drive in the latest models of more expensive cars. But when your lease is over, you will have to return that Explorer. Whatever car you can afford to buy, you get to keep it, and it will always have a resell or trade-in value if you wanted to later upgrade to a newer car.Furthermore, people who lease cars are often shocked by how much they must pay when the lease is over. Most leases limit you to a certain number of miles, and if you go over that allotment, you must pay for each mile. As a result, at the end of your lease, you may end up paying thousands of dol- lars in mileage fees. For example, if your lease covers you for 25,000 miles over three years, but you drive 40,000, that’s an extra 15,000 miles. At $.11 per mile, that’s $1,650 you’ll have to pay. And you still won’t have a car.In addition, when you lease, you still have to pay for regular maintenance and repairs to the vehicle. Since you must return the car when your lease expires, you are paying to repair someone else’s car. If you own the car, how- ever, you would know that every dollar you spend maintaining or repairing the car is an investment in a real piece of property—your property, not someone else’s.By now, the beneﬁts of buying over leasing should be clear. But if you’re still not convinced, remember this fundamental fact: If you lease, when your lease is up, after you’ve made all of your monthly payments, paid for extra mileage, and paid for repairs, you must give the car back. It isn’t yours to keep, no matter how much the lease cost you. Whatever make or model you can afford to buy, it is yours to keep after you make your payments. There’s no giving it back, and that makes all the difference."

A lot of people think leasing is better, than buying. I think it makes more sense to buy. It really actually costs less money in the long run.With a lease you can pay less each month for a car. If you buy it you’d probably have to pay a lot more each month, like a hundred dollars more a month. But the good thing about buying is you get to keep the car. With a lease of course, you have to give the car back.With a lease you also have to pay for the extra miles you put on the car.45  You are only allowed to put so many miles on the car and if you go over that, you have to pay for each mile. That can add up to thousands of dollars even though its only a few sense for each mile.You will also need to pay for any repairs on the car just like you would if you owned it, which you don’t, because you still have to give it back. When you owne the car, you still have to pay for repairs, but, it’s your car. Leasing feels like throwing money away."

Use speciﬁc reasons and examples to support your position.",6,"Benjamin Franklin is one of the greatest ﬁgures in American history, and I have a great deal of respect for this incredible inventor, politician, and writer. But I must respectfully disagree with his claim that, “Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. There is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.” I agree that money in and of itself does not make a person happy; but I believe that money can help provide one thing that is essen- tial to happiness: good health.While money can do nothing to change our genetic makeup and our physiological predisposition to illness and disease, it can give us access to better healthcare throughout our lives. This begins with prenatal care and childhood vaccinations. In impoverished third-world countries, infant mor- tality rates are three, four, even ten times higher than in the United States, and as many as one in four women still die in childbirth because they do not have access to modern medical care. Sadly, people who are too poor to46  afford vaccinations and routine healthcare for their children watch help- lessly as many of those children succumb to illnesses and diseases that are rarely fatal here in the United States.Money also enables us to afford better doctors and see specialists throughout our lives. If your child has difﬁculty hearing, for example, and you have insurance (which costs money) or cash, you can see a hearing spe- cialist and pay for therapy. If you have migraines that make you miserable, you can see a headache specialist and afford medication and treatment. Hav- ing money also means being able to afford preventative measures, such as taking vitamins and getting regular check-ups. It means being able to afford products and services that can enhance our health, such as gym member- ships, organic foods, and acupuncture.Another important thing money can do is enable us to live in a healthy environment. Many of the world’s poorest people live in dirty, dangerous places—unsanitary slums crawling with diseases and health hazards of all sorts. In a particularly poor area of the Bronx, for example, children had an abnormally high rate of asthma because their families couldn’t afford to move away from the medical waste treatment plant that was poisoning the air.Money can also help us be healthy by enabling us to afford proper heat- ing and cooling measures. This includes being able to afford a warm win- ter coat and the opportunity to cool off at a pool or in the ocean. On a more basic level, it means being able to afford heat in the winter and air condi- tioning in the summer. During heat waves, victims of heat stroke are often those who are too poor to afford air conditioning in their apartments. In extreme cold, the same is true: people who freeze to death or become gravely ill from the cold are often those who are unable to afford high heat- ing bills.Having money may not make people happy, but it sure goes a long way toward keeping them healthy. And as they say, if you haven’t got your health, you haven’t got anything."
"The inventor and statesman Benjamin Franklin said, “Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. There is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.” Do you agree with this statement? Why or why not? Use speciﬁc reasons and examples to support your position.",4,"Benjamin Franklin once said that “Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. There is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.” I do not agree with this statement because money can buy access to good health care. In my opinion, good health is essential to happiness. Therefore, money can make you happy by keeping you healthy.Money ﬁrst of all can get you access to good doctors, even specialists if you need them. With money, you can afford all kinds of things, like tests47  that check for diseases and special treatments if you ﬁnd something wrong. If your pregnant you can get good pre-natal care and have a good birth, while in poor countries lots of women die in childbirth and lots of babies die while their infants.If you have money you can buy an air conditioner so it’s not too hot in the summer and you can afford to have heat all winter. If you don’t you might suffocate in the heat or freeze to death. You can also stay out of poor areas like slums which are unhealthy and dangerous to live in.As they say, money can’t buy you love, but I think it can buy you good health, and if you don’t feel good, it’s hard to be happy."

Why or why not? Use speciﬁc reasons and examples to support your position.",1,"Benjamin Franklin was a great inventer of America. He famous for invent- ing electricity. He also wrote a lot. One thing he said once was that “Money never made a man happy yet, nor will it. There is nothing in its nature to produce happiness.” Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Every one has their opinion. Another question is what is happiness? I also like to be with my family and friends.Some times I need money to spend with them, like to ﬂy on a plane to see my brother in Colorado. It is as beautifol there as every one told me it was."
Some states have now made it illegal to drive while talking on a hand-held cellular phone. Do you think this is a good law that should be passed in other states as well? Why or why not? Explain your answer.,6,"No matter how careful a driver you may be, when you do something else while driving, whether it’s drinking coffee, changing the radio station, look- ing at a map, or making a call on your cell phone, you endanger yourself and others because you are distracted from your driving. Even a fraction of a second of distraction is enough to cause an accident. While no state can make it illegal to drink coffee or switch stations while driving, all states can, and should, make it illegal to drive while talking on a cellular phone.In the past decade, as the popularity of cellular phones has risen, so have the number of accidents caused by people talking on their cell phones. Whether they were dialing a number, listening to a message, or simply in a heated conversation, they were momentarily distracted from the task of driving, and suddenly—crash! Fortunately, many of these accidents have48  been minor fender-benders. But all too many have been deadly accidents that could have been prevented by a stricter cell-phone use laws.Cell phone proponents may argue that talking on a cell phone is no more dangerous than, for example, having a cup of coffee while on the road or talking to someone in the back seat. But unlike a cup of coffee, which you can put down between sips, you must keep the phone in your hand. That means that you have only one hand on the wheel while you’re driving. That makes cell phones doubly dangerous: not only are you distracted by dialing or by the conversation; you are also driving one-handed, which means you are less in control. If you suddenly need both hands on the wheel to prevent an accident or to keep your car from sliding, the extra second it takes to get your hand back on the wheel can make the difference between an accident and an accident narrowly averted, between a serious injury and a minor one. Cell phones are also dangerous because when you are busy talking, espe- cially if you really have to concentrate on the matter you are discussing, your mind is not fully focused on the road, and this has a signiﬁcant effect on your reaction time. You will be slower to make important driving deci- sions such as how soon to brake and when to switch lanes, and you will beless able to respond to situations on the road.Many people use cell phones to report accidents and emergencies, to let loved ones know they’ll be late, and to stay in touch when they’re out of town. I’m not arguing that you shouldn’t have a cell phone in your car. What I am saying is that you shouldn’t be driving when you’re talking on that phone. Until your state outlaws hand-held cell phones in cars, pull over to the side of the road when you are ready to make a call. It may add a few extra minutes to your commute, but it just might save your life."
Some states have now made it illegal to drive while talking on a hand-held cellular phone. Do you think this is a good law that should be passed in other states as well? Why or why not? Explain your answer.,4,"Driving with a cell phone is dangerous, and it should be illegal. Its all ready illegal in some states, in my opinion it, should be illegal in all of them.First of all, driving with a cell phone is dangerous because your dis- tracted. Especially when you’re dialing a number, then you’re not even looking at the road. What if the cars in front of you suddenly stop?You can also be distracted by the conversation you are having and lose focus from driving. This means that you may not be able to react quick enough to dangers on the road. Another problem is that with a cell phone, you don’t have both hands on the wheel, and that’s for the whole time you’re talking. You can’t make sharp turns and handle sudden curves with just one hand.49  Lots of people think, oh, it’s just one quick call, no problem. But even just a quick call makes you distracted, even just for a quick second. That’s enough to cause an accident. So don’t drive when you need to talk on your cell phone. Instead, be safe and pull over."
Some states have now made it illegal to drive while talking on a hand-held cellular phone. Do you think this is a good law that should be passed in other states as well? Why or why not? Explain your answer.,1,"In many states of the United States they make it again the law for talking while driving with cellular telephone. In my opinion, is this a good idea? I believe.For to many accidents, are happening with the cellular telephone, the driver he don’t see (what happens) ahead. This terrible for every one espe- cial the ones they getting hurt. Some accident really very terrible and, everyone going to the hospital. This should be the law."
Some states have now made it illegal to drive while talking on a hand-held cellular phone. Do you think this is a good law that should be passed in other states as well? Why or why not? Explain your answer.,6,"A single overweight person might not warrant much attention. But a nation whose population is increasingly obese is cause for concern. In the United States, 14% of children and teenagers are categorized as overweight. Why is this a serious problem instead of simply a matter of personal choice? What are the causes of this constantly increasing percentage of obese per-61  sons? What is to be done about this, and what organized steps should be taken to solve the problem?Just as there are ripples from a stone thrown into the water, there are far- reaching and unending effects resulting from obesity. From a psychologi- cal perspective, most obese persons would prefer not to be overweight. Our society gloriﬁes the ultra-thin, so if you are obese you do not ﬁt in with acceptable modes of appearance. We know that children are often cruel about taunting their heavy classmates. All too often we hear friends say, “I’ve got to lose weight before that trip,” or “before the wedding.” How- ever, there are more objective measures of the negative results of obesity. Type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, an illness with serious consequences, includ- ing damage to the heart, damage to the eyes and difﬁculty in healing infec- tions is attributed to obesity. Public health agencies are dealing with the continual rise in this type of diabetes. Asthma is also on the rise as a result of the obesity epidemic as are sleep disorders such as sleep apnea. Recent research indicates a relationship between some types of cancer and obesity. Society pays the price when citizens are ill, are unable to work, and require constant medical care.Questions arise: “What can be done about this?” “Who or what is to blame?” Discussing blame is a delicate problem. There are undoubtedly overweight individuals with inherited tendencies toward diabetes or heart disease, and there is evidence that a hormone that gives people a sense of fullness after eating may be lacking in some obese people. Yet, knowing that they are at risk would suggest that steps be taken to thwart the onset of the physical consequences of obesity.Most authorities agree that diet is key. The avoidance of foods high in sugars, carbohydrates, and saturated fats is recommended by most physi- cians as a way to ward off obesity and its dire consequences. But this is dif- ﬁcult in our society where fast food outlets are ubiquitous, where we are bombarded by advertising of unhealthy foods, and where we lead increas- ingly sedentary lives. Sugar-laden soft drinks are sold in schools and prof- its from these sales are high. An elementary school in Los Angeles received$50,000 for allowing Coca-Cola to install its vending machines. This com- pany and Pepsico constitute the majority of the school soft drink market, and while they proﬁt from the present sales, they are also building brand loyalty and creating future habitual soft drink consumers.Lack of adequate exercise is a concomitant contributor to the rise in obe- sity. Children are often playing video games instead of engaging in sports. Adults watch television instead of exercising. People will drive around62  shopping centers to avoid walking a few extra steps. The quintessential “couch potato” invention has just been invented. Now you can get a uni- versal remote with which, from your comfortable couch, you can not only control your television, but your oven, lights and, presumably, other things which we can only begin to imagine.Society suffers when its population is increasingly unhealthy, has rising medical costs, notes absenteeism from work and school, and has social inequalities. This latter result, social inequalities, reﬂects the assertion recently made by a school administrator that 50% of children in poorer school districts are obese. Experts seem to believe that obesity is a problem that can, with diligence and desire, be eliminated or at least mitigated with two simple changes in lifestyle—eating more healthily and getting more exercise."
Some states have now made it illegal to drive while talking on a hand-held cellular phone. Do you think this is a good law that should be passed in other states as well? Why or why not? Explain your answer.,4,"Obesity is a growing problem in this country. But I don’t think obese peo- ple actually want to be overweight because being overweight makes you get sick more often. Doctors say obesity causes asma, diabetes, and even heart disease. If people understood the effects of obesity, they would probably try harder to lose weight because no one likes to get sick. Being sick makes kids miss school and adults miss work and often causes a lot of hospital bills. So, in the end, obesity hurts kids educations and their parent’s jobs and is also incredibly expensive.Lately, more and more kids are becoming obese. This is a real problem because teenagers shouldn’t have to worry about their heart! They should be playing sports and having fun and getting an education. But when stu- dents have asma attacks, they can’t breath, which means they can’t go to class or take gym. So, having asma and missing school interferes with their education.Obesity also causes diabetes, a really terrible disease that can make you blind. Of course, some people get diabetes because their parents have it not because they’re obese. Heart disease is the number one cause of death in America and can also be caused by obesity. In a way, obesity is more than just being overweight, its like three diseases wrapped up in one. That’s exactly why everyone needs to learn more about it, so we can stop it from getting out of hand.Some people may be obese because they don’t like to exercise. But they need to ﬁnd a way to exercise because if you exercise every day, you will probably stay in shape. Then you won’t have to pay expensive doctor bills63  or go to the hospital as often and everyone will be healthier, miss less school and work, and be better off."

"Describe the purposes of the Internet. Include various viewpoints, including that of users and providers.",6,"In today’s world, the ﬁrst place people turn to when there is a question to be answered, information to be located, or people to be contacted, is often the Internet. Yes, the Internet may have supplanted the traditional ency- clopedia as well as a number of other sources of service and information. We can make reservations, plan vacations, play interactive games, learn a language, listen to music or radio programs, read the newspaper, and ﬁnd out about a medical condition, without coming face to face with another person. There is no limit to the subject matter you can research on the Internet. Just go to a search engine such as Yahoo or Google, type in a few key words or a Web address, and presto, you will probably summon links to more sources than you could have imagined. The Internet allows you to remain at your computer and shop no matter what you wish to purchase. And if you are looking for a bargain or an unusual item, you can go to a popular auction site and either sell or buy.If, however, you do wish to speak directly to a person, there are the chat rooms. On practically any given topic, groups of people converse with each other. They may be giving opinions about a perfect travel itinerary, a book, or even a political party. The most prevalent use of the Internet also involves directly writing to a person, and that is the sending of e-mail mes- sages to friends and associates. It is possible to communicate instantly with anyone, anywhere, as long as there is an Internet connection. In a world where people frequently travel, where families do not necessarily live in the same neighborhoods, e-mail is a means of making simple, inexpensive, immediate contact. Not only do we send verbal messages, but also now digital cameras take pictures that can be stored and then instantly trans- mitted on the Internet.64  Unfortunately, there are individuals who subvert the opportunities offered by this technology. They are less than honest, disguise their iden- tity, bilk people in ﬁnancial scams, and entice unsuspecting people, includ- ing children, into giving them personal information. Caveats about these problems are currently being publicized so those Internet users will not be victimized.Of course, the Internet providers, such as AOL, hope to make a proﬁt, and there is usually a monthly fee for the hookup. To increase the proﬁts, the providers sell advertising, which may pop up on the subscriber’s screen and require the user to stop and respond, either positively or negatively, to the ads. When you consider that, among other things, you can hear a concert, read a book, visit a museum and view its contents, visit the websites of numerous individuals and organizations, play a game with one or more peo- ple, and pay your bills, you will realize that the uses of the Internet are too vast for a short list. Most would agree that much has been added to peoples’ lives by connecting them to the Internet, and that we probably cannot antic-ipate what new purposes will be explored in the future."
"Describe the purposes of the Internet. Include various viewpoints, including that of users and providers.",4,"The internet is very useful. You can send e-mail to your friends.

Describe various styles of shoes as well as reasons for their popularity.,6,"Visit the shoe department of a large department store and you will undoubt- edly see a variety of shoe styles on display. This suggests that the store is sat- isfying the customers’ desire for an assortment of shoes.Logically, shoes should protect and support the feet. An example of such a shoe is the sneaker. Originally an inexpensive canvas, rubber soled version of a leather oxford (a shoe with laces), the sneaker has become increasing popular and has supplanted the oxford for regular everyday use for many students and some adults. Sneakers, like living things, have evolved and branched out. They are now mostly made of leather and have much cush- ioning to minimize stress on the wearer’s joints. They have become spe- cialized into separate sneakers for walking, running, tennis, and basketball. There are sneakers for aerobic classes, and for the eclectic exerciser, there are cross trainers. There is justiﬁcation for their popularity for they are comfortable and are engineered to properly support the foot during a par- ticular activity. It has also become acceptable to wear sneakers with street clothes because they just plain feel good. An endorsement by a popular ath- lete spreads their appeal as well as increases their cost.At the opposite end of the spectrum is a shoe style that is uncomfortable, harmful, and impractical. These adjectives describe the women’s shoes with pointed toes and thin, high heels. Doctors say that the pointed toes cause deformities of the feet, and the three to four inch heels are unstable and can cause back problems. With so many negatives, why are these styles consis- tently popular? Wearers may admit that they are uncomfortable, but say that they are fashionable and that, in time, they get used to them. Histori- cally, people follow fashion, and here again, advertising preys upon this need to keep up with the current trends.A shoe that can be totally practical, simply fashionable, or a combination of both, is the boot. For cold or inclement weather, no footwear is as desir- able as an insulated, rubber-soled boot. Boots are popular because they are practical, long lasting, and a desirable fashion accessory. But there are boots whose entire function is fashion. Yes, these boots have the same pointed toes66  and spiked heels as the shoes described above, but they are boots because the leather continues high on the leg.Historically, shoe styles change, but there are some shoes that are com- fortable as well as fashionable, like sandals and sneakers. And, there are those styles some would consider fashionable but harmful to the feet, or worse. If the choice were between comfort or fashion, many people would probably risk discomfort in order to be fashionable."
Describe various styles of shoes as well as reasons for their popularity.,4,"Shoes are popular because they’re necessary for doing almost anything. You need them to walk, play sports, and even to enter drug stores and restau- rants. Without them, you’d have to sit at home all day. Shoes also protect your feet when your walking on a hot sidewalk or hiking in the woods. Nowadays, people even use shoes to make fashion statements. Some shoes are more expensive than ever just because they’re so popular.My favorite shoes are my sneakers. Everyone at school has sneakers because they’re required for gym class. They’re also popular outside of school because they come in so many colors and styles. I have a lot of friends at school but none of us has the exact same pair of sneakers. In high school, sneakers are a good way to express your personality, and on top of that they’re really comfortable.Sandals are also popular, especially in the summer, because they’re also comfortable and don’t hurt your feet. You can move your toes around when you where them and they don’t make your feet sweat like sneakers some- times do.I also have new high heel boots with a 4 inch heel. They hurt my feet when I wear them for a long time, but I don’t care because they look so cool. I think looking good is worth the pain. Besides, I only wear them on spe- cial ocasions. My mother thinks I’ll end up ruining my feet, but you should see the heels she wears to work!"
Describe various styles of shoes as well as reasons for their popularity.,1,I like shoe styles they are good. One time I went to buy shoes and my cuzin was there and we huged becuz we did not see each other for ever. We went to her house and watched tv. I need new sneakers. I like sneakers. They cost to much so I cant get them now. I want high heels my mother wears them and they kill her feet but I want them to. Everyone wants them.67  
Math is a required subject. Explain why it is so important.,6,"If you complain about the universality of math as a required subject, just try and spend one day without encountering some form of mathematics. From page numbers to prices to today’s date, math puts things in order and enables us to compare quantitatively. Figuring how much time is required, how much of an ingredient must be measured, how much carpet to buy, all of these everyday experiences require familiarity with math. To survive ﬁnancially you must use math to allocate your resources. If you want to invest in a business or in the stock market you must know how to deal with the numbers. Understanding graphs and other analyses about the economy or politics or consumer conﬁdence are enhanced by the applications of math. Mathematical applications in the study of science are essential. Track- ing the orbits of planets and the locations of stars in the galaxy cannot be done without numerical comparisons. Every discipline, from archeology to zoology, beneﬁts in some way from the use of mathematics.Practical reasons for the need for mathematics are omnipresent, but there are other, perhaps more esoteric reasons, for interest in this subject. The amazing coincidences found in numbers provide continual fascination. An example is the fact that the sum of the numbers in the products of the “9-times table” add up to nine. Nine times ﬁve equals forty-ﬁve, and four plus ﬁve equals nine. Similarly, the numbers in the product of seven times nine also equal nine. Mathematicians are also especially fascinated with unique geometric relationships. An example is the fact that three pyramids of the same height will exactly ﬁt into a prism of equal height.A teacher of mathematics once told me, “Math is in everything,” and some people say, “Mathematics is the something for which the world was written.” These are reasons enough for requiring its study."
Math is a required subject. Explain why it is so important.,4,"Math is a required subject because it is important in school and in every day life. If you don’t understand simple math, you’ll never know if the cashier is giving you the right change or if your getting a good deal on a new car. Without math, shopping would be impossible. You wouldn’t be able to ﬁg- ure out what you could afford. Some people think they don’t need math but they do. You need math to know if its hot or cold outside or to know what pages you have to study for a particular test.68  Math is also important because you need to use it in almost every other subject. Sometimes you need math in science to make a graph or to meas- ure amounts for an experiment. There’s no way you could pass science with- out math. I use math in history class to remember dates and in English class we use it to understand poetry. You can’t even write a haiku without math because you wouldnt be able to count the number of syllables and lines.In every day life, you need math to balance your checkbook and to know how much time you have before the movie starts. Without it, you’d never be on time, and your friends would hate you. Math is necessary even to make a simple phone call. When you think about it numbers are everywhere so it’s important to understand them."
Math is a required subject. Explain why it is so important.,1,We have to take math. I don’t like it. It is stupid. We have to draw in the boxes on graf paper what is this art. I faled art anyway so why do it in math. I can use the kalkuate so I don’t even need to study it where allowd to use the kalkuate and so I do not care if math is important.
Describe a major environmental problem and what you believe should be done about it.,6,"A major environmental problem, the magnitude of which we are just begin- ning to realize, is global warming. When people say that the winters aren’t as cold as they used to be, or that there was deﬁnitely more snow in past years, they are correct. In addition to these personal testimonials, there is concrete visual evidence of global warming. Most noticeable is the deple- tion of the ice caps. In recent years, glaciers have been receding in greater amounts than in former years. One only has to visit a national park where this recession is marked with signs indicating where the glacier reached in a particular year. The visitor can see how much further away from a par- ticular spot the ice is at the present moment.When the ice caps, made of fresh water, melt, they change the salinity of the oceans, change the currents, and change the conditions for survival for myriad species. Additionally, invasive species might move in, affecting the entire ecosystem. This has a domino effect, as all species are interdepend- ent and survive according to predictable sources of food and living condi- tions. A speciﬁc example recently described on an environmental calendar69  told of the effect of global warming on polar bears. The bears cannot go out on the melted ice, which is how they get their food. This causes them to lose body fat and even to be unable to give birth to cubs.Global warming causes ﬂooding, and because the warming of the earth causes dryness, ﬁres increase.When speaking of the causes of global warming, some experts say that ice ages followed by warming have been cyclical throughout the eons and that there is not much that can be done about it. However, most scientists believe that the actions of humans have speeded up this process. They blame the increased burning of wood and fossil fuels—oil and coal—on an increasing population needing heat for warmth and cooking. More energy consumption places carbon dioxide and other pollutants in the atmosphere. Warm air trapped around the earth has been deemed the greenhouse effect.While we cannot stop the naturally occurring climate changes, we can try to mitigate the rapid warming by reducing our use of fossil fuels. Much publicity has been given to the love that Americans have for sports utility vehicles which burn an inordinate amount of fuel and which are not required for the kind of ordinary driving done by most owners. There are numerous additional ways in which we can reduce our dependence on these fuels, ranging from insulating our homes, to lowering the thermostat in winter, and raising it when we use air conditioning. Perhaps researchers can develop alternate sources of energy. Presently an automobile is being devel- oped that uses gas initially and then automatically switches to electricity. Theoretically, this car will be able to run for ﬁfty miles on one gallon of gasoline. Additionally, we can support the scientiﬁc study of the effects of global warming. Perhaps we can predict such things as where ﬂoods will occur or where crops will have difﬁculty surviving and take steps to over- come these problems.One thing is certain. Global warming is a serious environmental prob- lem with ramiﬁcations that affect almost every aspect of life."
Describe a major environmental problem and what you believe should be done about it.,4,"Global warming which means that it is getting warmer all over the globe, is a serious environmental problem. It is bad for the environment, nature, animals, and humans as well. Global warming causes a lot of glaciers to melt which then causes more ﬂoods and makes the ocean warmer which could hurt certain kinds of ﬁsh. Global warming also leads to more ﬁres in gen- eral and increases the rate of cancer in humans, especially skin cancer.In order to stop global warming, we should study the greenhouse effect.70  501 Writing  PromptsBecause we use too much oil and gas and pollute the air on a regular basis, hot air can’t escape the atmosphere. We need to use less oil and gas so the hot air can get out. People don’t need to drive trucks and SUVs all the time because they use more gas and cause more air pollution. We also don’t have to use air conditioning all the time. People need to remember that minivans and air conditioning are luxuries not neccessities.If everyone agreed to change their habits, it would help the environment a lot. So, we should ﬁnd out what needs to be done to solve this serious environmental problem and do whatever it takes."
Describe a major environmental problem and what you believe should be done about it.,1,A environmental problem is called global warming. The globe is getting hot.

How do they no do they mesure all over the globe. 1 day it was so cold my hands froze and I got in trubel because I was not aloud out so I had no time to gebt gloves. I gess I don’t like global warming if it gets to hot but maybe its only far away anwe don’t need to wory about it hear.
Describe how communication has changed in the last twenty years.,6,"Who could have predicted twenty years ago that communication would change as radically as it has? Today, communication is instantaneous. No longer do we have to use a pen, pencil, or typewriter to write a letter. No longer do we have to use a postal service to mail it. No longer do we have to wait for a response that takes several days. Nor do we have to stay near a telephone or search for a public phone while traveling. Things have speeded up exponentially.In the last twenty years we have beneﬁted from tremendous changes in telecommunication. The relatively simple change to portable phones enabled us to roam around the house while chatting, not limited by the length of the cord that attaches the receiver to the base of the telephone. Then came the beeper, allowing us to get a message when away from a tele- phone. Now, of course, there is the ubiquitous cell phone. Watch the crowds walking along a sidewalk, and you can’t help noticing people pur- posefully striding along while talking on their cell phones.What if we must write a message? We now have e-mail. We send these messages immediately after typing them on the computer keyboard and never have to go to the Post Ofﬁce. No more “snail mail.” Perhaps we have71  a written copy that must be sent but cannot be conveniently sent via the computer. Simply dial a phone number, push a few buttons, send a FAX. The copy is transmitted to the receiver at once. The ability to telecommute is almost like handing the copy to the recipient. What a difference twenty years has made. Just as most of us could not imagine the speed and ease of communication in the twenty-ﬁrst century, we probably cannot anticipate the changes that will occur in the next twenty years. Perhaps we will be able to send instant messages simply by thinking about them, from one brain to the brain of the intended recipient."
Describe how communication has changed in the last twenty years.,4,I believe communication has deﬁnitly changed in the last 20 years. It is much different. I can send e-mails to my friends every day. Even twice a day if I want. I could not do this a few years ago. It’s great. So I think commu- nication is much faster and I deﬁnitly think it is much easier if you have a computer. Every school and ofﬁce has a computer.I believe the best change is the cell phone. I have a cell phone that I carry everywhere I go. I can turn it off in the movie and it will vibrate (shake). Then I know I have a call and I can leave and answer it. I don’t think it is right for you to bother someone with your cell phone.I don’t even need stamps to send cards. I can send them on the computer. All my friends have e-mail. And if they don’t they don’t get a card untill they do.I can also send a FAX on the telephone if I have to send a copy right then. These are the ways communication has changed in the last 20 years.
Describe how communication has changed in the last twenty years.,1,Communication is talking. In some ways it has changed in the last 20 years. I think I can talk easily now because I cary around with my phone. It is pink and everyone likes it. Because I worked to earn it each month. You don’t have to read the paper you can watch tv if you want. Tv tells you about clothes and stuff that you care about. So communication is grate. Commu- nication is also the computer which is all over. I hate to rite so I use my cell but I could if I felt like it. My mother uses it. So she says it is much better.72  
"Discuss the events in the life of your favorite author, sports ﬁgure, or performer. Explain how these events relate to the person’s achievements.",6,"Herman Melville was a 19th century writer whose works foreshadowed themes that would become prevalent in the 20th century. He wrote about his distaste for the prevalent oppression of underlings, of the need to accept different cultures and to appreciate the contributions of ordinary people. His novels probe into psychological reasons for characters’ actions in a way that would be relevant today.Born into a New York family that was prominent, although in constant debt, Melville was forced to end his formal schooling at the age of twelve. He was nevertheless widely read and informed on numerous subjects, including, but not limited to, literature, art, science, biology, navigation, mythology, and geography. Thus, he was largely self-educated, as was Ish- mael, the narrator of Moby Dick, Melville’s most acclaimed novel. Ishmael said, “A whale ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.”Just as Ishmael’s experiential education mirrored Melville’s own informal schooling, so were many other aspects of his life reﬂected in his writings. Signing up as a cabin boy on a ship going to Liverpool, England, when he was 20, provided Melville with material for the novel, Redburn. The novel was about a lonely 20-year old orphan wandering around Liverpool and is thought to be the writer’s most autobiographical.Motivated by the need to earn money, Melville signed up for a four-year voyage as a common seaman in spite of the fact that his family connections could have easily gotten him an ofﬁcer’s commission. Melville had a pro- gressive view about equality that was unusual for his time. He believed in the dignity of all work, which was reﬂected in his sympathetic, even admir- ing, excruciatingly detailed, descriptions of the jobs of the working people in his writings. He decried nationalistic prejudice and believed that all peo- ple are related. He wrote, “You cannot shed a drop of American blood with- out shedding blood of the whole world.”Among the ﬁrst white men to explore the South Sea Islands, Melville was surely the ﬁrst literary artist to do so. Unable to bear the inhumane treat- ment on this long voyage, he deserted in the Marquesas Islands. He was ill and fortunately was cared for by a kindly native family. A grown son in the family was covered with tattoos, and Melville learned that these people were cannibals who feasted on their enemies. In order to leave, he had to escape, ﬁnding refuge on an Australian ship. He deserted from this ship also, land- ing in Tahiti. These experiences provided material for the novel Typee, about the South Sea Islands, the novel Omoo, based upon his experiences in Tahiti,73  and the novel White Jacket, which exposed the cruelty of navy ﬂogging. The tattooed man who cared for Melville provided the prototype for Quequeg, one of the most memorable characters in literature.Herman Melville also was a crewmember of a whaling voyage where he learned the intricacies involved in this type of multi-year voyage that he used as the setting for Moby Dick. This novel, considered a literary master- piece, provided a forum for Melville’s ideas about the necessity for con- nectedness. The savage, Quequeg, and the sailor, Ishmael, were mutually supportive of this theme. In addition, Melville was a great believer in democracy and the beneﬁts of diversity, and these beliefs were reﬂected in his descriptions of the crew on the whaling voyage. The ship was a metaphor for the world, with its crew coming from every known location and background, all being necessary for success. A monomaniacal captain, devoid of empathy, driven by his selﬁsh aims, and unable to connect with others, could only lead to disaster.Thus, Herman Melville’s real-life experiences undoubtedly made possi- ble his descriptive novels, but they would not have been possible without his independently drawn conclusions about the dignity of man and his place in the universe."
"Discuss the events in the life of your favorite author, sports ﬁgure, or performer. Explain how these events relate to the person’s achievements.",4,"Herman Melville was a 19th century American writer who wrote many famous books including Moby Dick. Like Moby Dick, most of his books where about topics that were of personal interest to him like ships and whaling. He spent a lot of time on ships and also knew a lot about whales. Melville led an excit- ing life and put a lot of that excitement into his books. Because his books were based on real life events and topics he knew alot about, the writing was incred- ibly detailed and vivid. When people read his books, even when people read them today, they feel as though they’ve been taken into another world. When you read Melville’s books, you learn a lot about whales and foreign lands, but you also learn a lot about him as a person.Moby Dick is a great book. After reading it, you can understand a lot more about Meville. The story is about a crazy man named Captain Ahab who wants to kill a great whale named Moby Dick. In the book, Melville really seems to care about his characters and makes it clear that all of the charac- ters are equal in his eyes. Ahab’s ship is supposed to be a symbol of the entire world and characters like Quequeg and Ishmael are simply every day peo- ple. Because Ahab is so selﬁsh, he ends up destroying the entire ship. After realizing that, Melville wants us to know that selﬁsh world leaders will also74  ruin the world if regular citizens like Ishmael and Quequeg aren’t given any power. Melville was all for democracy which you can easily tell after read- ing this book."
"Discuss the events in the life of your favorite author, sports ﬁgure, or performer. Explain how these events relate to the person’s achievements.",1,My clas had to read Moby dick. I learned about the author. He is Herman Melville and I like him he is brave he went on trips. I never went on many trips but I wuld. I wuld go to ﬂorida. He Herman never went there but he went other places and wrote about it.i don’t think nobody in my class akshuly read it.
Explain the causes and effects of not voting in elections.,6,"Voting is the privilege for which wars have been fought, protests have been organized, and editorials have been written. “No taxation without repre- sentation,” was a battle cry of the American Revolution. Women struggled for suffrage as did all minorities. Eighteen year olds clamored for the right to vote, saying that if they were old enough to go to war, they should be allowed to vote. Yet Americans have a deplorable voting history.Interviewing people about their voting habits is revealing. There are individuals who state, almost boastfully, that they have never voted. They somehow set themselves apart from the requirements of citizenship in a democracy. Many who avoid voting do so consciously. It is not as if they were ill or unavoidably detained on election day. Often they claim that their one vote doesn’t matter. “What’s one vote?” they ask. Perhaps one vote may not count in some elections, although there have been results determined by one or very few votes. In addition, the total of single votes that are not cast can add up to a signiﬁcant difference in a particular race. Some people blame the fact that they do not know enough about the issues for their absence from the voting booth. Others say that they avoid learning about the news because it is too depressing. In a democracy, we can express our opinions to our elected leaders, but more than half of us sometimes avoid choosing these people who make the policies that affect our lives.One of the effects of this statistic is that politicians will cater to the groups that do vote in large numbers, giving more weight to their needs than to those of other groups or of the general population. Since so many do not vote, elected ofﬁcials can, with impunity, promote policies that ben- eﬁt the special interests that contribute ﬁnancially to the election cam-75  paigns. Another effect of not voting is the free rein given to those in ofﬁce to disregard the expressed opinions of constituents. For if you do not vote, why should the candidate worry about you?It seems ironic that in this most democratic of societies, we abrogate the privilege for which so many have struggled. How many countries do not have a choice of candidates, yet their citizens are forced to participate in sham elections? In the United States we have choices. We can vote to ﬁre an ofﬁceholder who does not live up to our expectations by choosing an opponent at the next election, and we are free to choose someone whose ideas appeal to us.Perhaps a major reason for not voting is the failure to convey how pre- cious and unique is the right to vote and how important is each and every vote. The major effect is that we are voluntarily giving up our rights as cit- izens to ascertain that our elected ofﬁcials truly represent us. This is because we have not done our part in choosing them so in effect, we are telling these ofﬁcials that we don’t care enough to bother to vote."
Explain the causes and effects of not voting in elections.,4,"Many people do not vote because they think its a hassle or that their vote won’t make a difference. Some people say they don’t care who wins, but everyone should care because government ofﬁcials make decisions that effect all of us. People need to learn more about their own government. So many Americans think our government is made up of one person, the pres- ident! But there are so many other people involved and so many other elec- tions to think about too.Not having time to vote or not knowing who to vote for is no excuse for not voting at all. People should take the time to learn as much as they can about the people who are running and make an informed decision. If you don’t vote then you’ll never get what you want and you won’t be able to complain when politicians make bad decisions.But if you’re smart and vote for whoever you feel is the best candidate, then if that person is elected, you can know that it’s their responsibility to listen to you. Our government is supposed to be for the people and run by the people, so everyone should realize it is their right and also their respons- bility to vote during every election."
Explain the causes and effects of not voting in elections.,1,Most people don’t vote I wouldn’t my mother don’t she says she has no time she is so bizy she works and how can she vote if she works. My brother says76  if you vote you can called to the juree and who need that his friend had it and it was boring and he culdve lost his job.

Explain how to have a winning baseball team.,6,"Whether professional or amateur, a baseball team, like a ﬁne meal, needs the right ingredients to create a winning result. Talented athletes are the ﬁrst requirement. After that, astute coaching, which discerns and then develops the unique capabilities of the players, can be as important as the athletes themselves. Flexibility and the willingness to try different strategies are the hallmarks of winning coaches. All the talent in the world could be wasted without creative and shrewd coaching.A player with the ability to sprint, needed both for inﬁeld defense and for speedy base running, can be invaluable. A fast runner can steal bases and get to ﬁrst base with a carefully placed bunt.Good pitching is essential for a winning baseball team. A pitcher who is “on” is the ﬁrst line of defense in baseball. It is well known that the pitcher is often the poorest hitter, but it is the pitcher who keeps the opponents from scoring. The pitcher’s teammates accept this and acknowledge that it is their job to score the runs. Here again, a good coach decides who is the optimum pitcher for today’s game, and equally important, when to take a tired or poorly performing pitcher out of the game.Recruiting strong and consistent batters will be a factor in creating a win- ning baseball team. Having a home run hitter with several players who can be counted on to get base hits and pinch hits are needed because the best pitching and the best ﬁelding will be for naught if runs aren’t scored.Even with a plethora of natural ability, to become a winning baseball team, the players must continually practice, not only to maintain their skills, but also to improve them. In fact, a motivated player who practices diligently may eventually surpass those with superior natural ability that is not devel- oped. Along with this desire to continually improve one’s individual playing ability, there is the motivation to succeed because of loyalty to the group. This type of esprit de corps can make the difference between a good and a win- ning baseball team. Putting the team ﬁrst, while striving to give one’s all, puts the ﬁnishing touches on the recipe for a winning baseball team.77  "
Explain how to have a winning baseball team.,4,"A winning baseball team would need good hitters, fast runners, a skilled pitcher and catcher, and a knowledgable and patient coach. It would also need to have a group of players who got along without any jealousy or hos- tility and were capable of rooting for each other.Good hitters and runners are important because you have to get alot of hits and runs to win. You can’t win without scoring runs. Also, the runners need to be speedy, so they can get to the base before the ball gets there. You also have to have a skilled pitcher who can strike people out. The pitcher has to be good or else the other team will score more runs and you will lose. The catcher is important as well because if the catcher drops the ball when the pitcher throws it, that is an error.Finally, you also need to have a good coach who can help the players improve and who knows when to put certain players in the game and when to take them out. The coach should keep the team running smoothly and solve any ﬁghts or disagreements."
Explain how to have a winning baseball team.,1,I don’t want to be on a baseball teem but I want to win if I do. My brother did and he never got a hit and he wont even look at me so who cars about baseball. I think you need to be a athleet and take lessons. And I think the uniforms are ugly I don’t look good in it and it is swetty. I will pick the best players if I have to play so I mite as well win right.
Explain how to choose the right college.,6,"One of the most important decisions young adults make is where to go to school. Your college education will affect the rest of your life, so you should weigh your options carefully. The “perfect” school may not exist, but I believe there are three factors that are integral to choosing the right college: location, size, and curriculum. You can narrow down your search based on these criteria.First, you should consider location. Some questions you should ask your- self include: Do I prefer to live in a city, the suburbs, or a rural area? Do I want to live in a temperate or colder climate? Do I prefer to be near my family, or in another part of the country? The answers to these questions will help you make the best choice.Second, you should consider size. Perhaps your high school experience78  will affect your choice of colleges. If you attended a small high school with a low teacher-student ratio, you may be accustomed to small class sizes and knowing your fellow students extremely well. On the other hand, if you attended a large high school, you may be used to new faces and larger classes. Would you prefer a school such as UCSB with 50,000 students, or a smaller school with fewer than 5,000 students? Remember, the attention you receive will be affected by the size of the student population.Finally, in order to choose the right college, you should take the time to decide what you would like to study. Although most colleges offer a myriad of courses, some schools specialize in certain ﬁelds and subjects or offer a wider selection of classes. For example, if you are interested in studying the Classics, did you know that the University of Texas has one of the best Clas- sics departments in the United States?Choosing the right college will require some effort. After you have decided the location, size, and curriculum you prefer, do some research. Learn about different colleges from your guidance counselor, the Internet, or from the colleges themselves. As with any important decision, make sure your choice is an educated one."
Explain how to choose the right college.,4,"It's not easy to choose the right college. There are three things you should consider when applying and deciding on a college. These are: location, classes, and size.First of all, you should decide where you want to go to school for four years. Decide if you want to be in a city or in a rural area, or if you want to be near to or far from your family. Then, if you know what you want to study, you should make sure that the college offers classes. There would be no need to go to a school that does not teach the Classics, if that's what you want to study. Finally, you should think about whether you want to go to a school with alot of students or not too many. For example, there are more than 50,000 students at UCSB, but maybe you prefer to go to a school with only 5,000.When deciding on a college, take your time and consider all of these things. College is important for the rest of your life so choose wisely!"

Your new job requires that you move to a different city. Describe the steps you will take to prepare for this move.,6,"Although Americans move more than most people in the world, a move is acknowledged to be one of life’s more stressful experiences. There are, how- ever, steps that can be taken and preparations that can be made which will mitigate the inevitable strain.If I were to move to a different city because of a job change, I would ﬁnd a sponsor in the new location, preferably someone who could give me insight into the kind of situation I could expect at the workplace and about the cultural and other differences in the new community. Different cities may be diverse in many ways: in ideas about appropriate behavior, in social expectations, and even in emotional reactions. If the city had special sites or events to generate civic pride, I would like to investigate those. Or there may be popular gathering places such as parks or cafés. This knowledge would be helpful in getting to understand the attitudes of the residents and to become part of the community.Spending time with a realtor would be a necessity, not only for ﬁnding a satisfactory residence, but also for gaining information about different neighborhoods, schools, libraries, and other community resources. In fact, it would be worthwhile to take the time to deliberately explore the com- munity by walking or driving around.My family members are interested in horses, sailing, and playing bridge. As a way to ﬁnd out how we can pursue these interests and ﬁnd people sim- ilarly inclined, we could visit stables, marinas, or social clubs. Striking up a conversation with people in these places and telling them that I am moving shortly would create a more knowledgeable transition. In addition to pick- ing the brains of people, there may be published material, such as maps and guidebooks, that could be informative. The same is true of Internet sites.All this preparation cannot eliminate the probability that leaving my friends, seeing my belongings picked up, packed, and moved to a different city, and facing new routines and new surroundings will be somewhat trau- matic. However, visualizing daily life in the new city can help make the move easier and the transition smoother.80  "
Your new job requires that you move to a different city. Describe the steps you will take to prepare for this move.,4,"If I ﬁnd out that I have to move to a different city I will try to make some plans. First of all I will have to ﬁnd a house. I will get a real estate person and look at houses. I will ﬁnd out how much they cost and if I can afford it. Then I will try to ﬁnd a nice area. The schools should be good and near the house and the church to.I like to play basketball and ride my bike and I will look around for places to play. Maybe I can meet some people who live there and make friends. Maybe they can show me around the place. I will try to meet someone who works at the new job. They can give me hints about how things are done there.I will say goodbye to my friends and give them my new address. It will be sad to move, but also there will be good things coming up. At least I wont be going in cold. I will have a place to live that is nice and I know maybe a few people already. I think I am starting to know what it will be like in my new home."

Many people spend a great deal of time with animals. Write about the relationships that people have with animals.,6,"Since they were ﬁrst domesticated, people have had relationships with ani- mals that have enhanced their lives. Probably animals that were trained to hunt and to retrieve prey were among the ﬁrst to become valuable to their owners. Useful animals include those used for transportation, for hauling loads, and, in recent times, to assist handicapped people. The latter are usu- ally dogs trained to guide the blind and to care for paraplegics. Although these animals have speciﬁc functions, it is probable that a special bond inevitably arises between them and the humans they serve and this goes far beyond the dependency each has for the other.Can a relationship with an animal improve a person’s health? Many81  recent reports seem to suggest this possibility. Pets give us abundant and unconditional love. Always happy to see us, our pets allow us to be our- selves, to talk to them, and even to believe that they understand us. When we come home, we might feel reluctant to “talk to ourselves,” but it is per- fectly all right to greet, chat, and interact with our dog, cat, bird, and even our ﬁsh. Some mental health workers are so insistent upon the beneﬁcial inﬂuences of pets that they have an animal present during therapy sessions, claiming that this causes patients to be more relaxed and responsive. Stud- ies have proven that relationships with animals reduce stress and actually can measurably lower blood pressure.For people who are depressed or living alone, having a pet is not only therapeutic; it is a means of encouraging a healthier lifestyle. A pet owner must live according to a regular timetable so that the pet can be fed and cared for appropriately. For dog owners, there is an additional social ben- eﬁt that accrues from having to go outdoors for a walk. Encountering other dog walkers often leads to further social interaction and, perhaps, friend- ship. For cat owners, there is the admiration for the cat’s characteristic inde- pendence, which makes any affection from the cat so much more meaningful. Keeping the bird feeders ﬁlled gives a sense of satisfying the needs of creatures that, in turn, delight us with their beauty and their antics. Other beneﬁcial effects of relationships with animals continue to be dis- covered. A recent article suggests that kindness to people and animals may be interconnected. Role-playing that increases children’s empathy for ani- mals helps them not only psychologically, but also physically and socially. Another discovery shows that riding horses, for reasons not completely understood, has been shown to beneﬁt autistic children. Pet owners can now volunteer to take their pets to hospitals and nursing homes where res-idents seem to welcome them.It is probable that continued research will shed additional light on what happens when people and animals form a bond. For the present, it is cer- tain that almost anyone can beneﬁt from the resulting security, under- standing, fun, laughter, and love that come from having a pet."
Many people spend a great deal of time with animals. Write about the relationships that people have with animals.,4,"I enjoy my pets. I have a cat and a bird and I like to spend time with them. When no one is home I play with my cat, or I may try to hold my bird. When I have a pet I feel good and happy. Some people have horses for pets. They get to ride them and take care of them. Even if you have a cat and don’t have to take it for a walk you have to feed it.82  One of the good things about pets is it teaches you things. I learned that I have to take care of my pets. They need me to feed them every day. I think they look at me funny if I forget or if I am late. I no that little babies like to pet animals and that they like them. So there are relationship with ani- mals for all ages. Old people like animals to. If they live alone they can have someone to talk to. Pets are like friends.I no a blind man and he has a seeing dog and he goes all over with it. So he has a relationship with his dog. The dog helps him and he helps the dog by loving and taking care of it.Relationships with animals are good for both people and animals."

Describe an especially memorable photo or picture.,6,"You might think a memorable picture would have vivid color, an appealing or inspirational theme, or be something you might want to display and look at every day. That is not the case with the picture that is most memorable to me. This picture is really a large mural, painted in 1937 by the Spanish artist, Pablo Picasso, to protest the bombing of a small village in northern Spain.Surprisingly, there is no vivid red color to show the ﬂowing blood. One must imagine this, for the mural is startlingly gray, black, and white. But there is no avoiding the horror of the images. The ﬁgures are not realisti- cally drawn, but are cubist and abstract, and it is apparent that innocent civilians are being slaughtered. A mother screams with her mouth wide open, her head tipped back in heart-rending anguish, as she holds her dead baby. A soldier lies dead on the ground, clutching his broken sword, and three other people are shown in shock and agony. Animals, including a tor- tured horse and a crying bird, are also portrayed as innocent victims of a massacre. Some symbols are open to interpretation. What is the meaning of the bull, which seems simply to be observing, or of the light bulb emit- ting rays at the top of the mural? Does the bull symbolize brute force, and83  does the light bulb signify that there is hope? Yet there is no doubt that the distorted, horrible images are intended to shock the viewer. This depiction of human grief is a profound statement of the cruelty and senselessness of war. Limiting the pictures to black and white adds a funereal element to the shocking depiction of the catastrophe.The memory of the picture cannot be forgotten; it is a metaphor for the senselessness and the horror of war. While it was painted to protest atroc- ities in a long ago war, it is as relevant today as the recollection of the hor- rors of September 11th. Perhaps it should be shown to all those who contemplate starting a war. Would it be worth it to have another Guernica?"
Describe an especially memorable photo or picture.,4,The picture I remember is Guernica. It is by Picasso. It is not realist. The shapes don’t look real but you know what they are in real life. It is in black and white. It is not in color like most pictures. But it really gets to you. It shows people getting killed or already killed. A baby is killed and a soldier is killed. The mother is screaming because her baby is dead. You won’t for- get that.What this picture does is to make you know that war kills people and it is just awful. It kills people and it kills animals and even if you are not killed you will probly be screaming or crying. This picture could be for any war it doesn’t matter. You remember it because it makes you upset and you wish there would never be a war. Then people wouldn’t have to suffer. This pic- ture is memorable because you remember how the people suffered and they probly didn’t do anything.
Describe an especially memorable photo or picture.,1,I remember a picture that is very big. It is Guernica. It is about people dieing and screaming and horses. I don’t like it it dosent make sens. Who cared about a horse and why is it in black and white. I don’t like black and white movies or pithcers. My sister had black and whites at her wedding and of cours I hated it. But I do remember it because everyone is yelling.

Therefore, I felt obliged to write to you when I received the disappointing grade of “C” on my term paper.Checking the criteria you provided and thoroughly discussed in class, I felt that I complied with each one in a superior manner, not just passably, as reﬂected in my grade. Four arguments in support of my thesis were stated and each was in turn discussed with several relevant examples given. You required only three arguments. Bibliographical citations were given in the exact format you demonstrated in class. As suggested, Internet sites were used in addition to ﬁrst-person accounts and editorial material.Although I spent an inordinate amount of time on this project , I felt it to be most worthwhile because it was a wonderful learning experience. When I saw the grade on the paper, I looked in vain for comments or sug- gestions. It would be helpful to me if I understood how you arrived at this grade.

You want to organize a family reunion. Describe the steps you will take to contact people and to organize the event.,6,"My family is united genetically but not by proximity. We live in far-ﬂung locations, including three continents and both the northern and southern hemispheres. Some of us have kept in touch while others might as well be considered MIA. It would seem close to impossible to organize a family reunion for such a peripatetic group. Yet, that is what I decided to attempt. Initially I sent e-mails to all those I regularly heard from and requested any and all addresses of other relatives to be forwarded to me. South Africa was the farthest location and was the source of some previously unknown addresses. Internet searches yielded still more. How delighted I was that there seemed to be universal interest in the project. Several people volun- teered to help. We generated a list and added to it as soon as we receivedfurther information.Relatives were located in Alaska, Canada, and six states. Thus the ﬁrst big hurdle was overcome: the list of potential invitees. Then, with solicited input from all concerned, it was decided to choose a location near New York, the original point of origin of the family.It then became necessary to choose a site for the get-together and then to ﬁnd accommodations for approximately ﬁfty-ﬁve people ranging in age from under one year to eighty-ﬁve. An all-suite hotel, which agreed to charge reduced rates if a minimum number of reservations were conﬁrmed was selected. The hotel agreed to hold rooms for us until two weeks prior to the weekend of the get-together. A list of nearby motels and bed and breakfasts was also compiled. We now had the who, where, and when, the lat-86  ter being the last weekend in September when the weather was still mod- erate and travel not likely to be a problem. Why we were getting together seemed obvious. There was curiosity to catch up, and even to meet relatives known only by reputation.Now we came to the question of how the weekend would be organized. Since most people would be arriving on Friday, that day was to be relaxed and unstructured. On Saturday, there would be games and an informal pic- nic lunch in a nearby county park, the permission for which was easily obtained. Saturday night would be the highlight, a catered dinner in a restaurant which could easily hold a group of this size. People had been asked to bring photos and anecdotes and a list of speakers was generated. The youngest members would be introduced and those traveling great dis- tances would be recognized. The oldest members might wish to share their reminiscences. Sunday would again be an informal day, probably punctu- ated with hugs, the sharing of addresses, and promises to do this again. All of the activities would be recorded on videos and a digital camera so that they could easily be forwarded via e-mail. Thus the planning for a family reunion must begin well in advance of the date. Planners must seek out addresses of the relatives, must settle on a location, a date, and, of course, a place to stay. These would vary according to the size and needs of the group. Some groups might prefer to simply chat informally while others would appreciate planned activities. Once a family has done this, a second reunion would be much easier. The addresses are known, faces can be asso- ciated with names, and an evaluation of the previous schedule can be solicited. One caveat: have alternate plans in case of bad weather."
You want to organize a family reunion. Describe the steps you will take to contact people and to organize the event.,4,"The ﬁrst step in planning a family reunion is having a family. Who is included? Do you invite the divorced ones? After you decide who to invite you should make up a list. Then you should call them, maybe getting some- one to help as this is a big job.The second step is to decide what to do. So you need to know exactly or pretty nearly how many are coming. So you have to pick a date that is good for everyone. Will it be just one day. Or two? You could play games and have people tell stories. It would be fun to hear about things the old peo- ple remember. Will you all get together or will it be by ages? You will have to decide. I think it is best to have all ages see each other and become friends if possible.The third step is deciding where to get together. How about your house?87  Do you have room? Do you want the mess? If everyone brings something you will probly still have to get most of the stuff and have the most work anyway. I would do it one time and then have someone else take a turn.So you now have everybody together for a family reunion. I hope it is fun. I hope it is not boring. I must tell you that some of my known relatives are boring but they are my relatives."

What if some- one couldn’t get there. Well that’s life. What if they didn’t like the food— hot dogs and hamburgers—well we could ask people to bring something.One thing I wanted was to see pitchers of my aunt’s and uncles and my mom and dad when they were young. Its hard to believe that they were ever kids. Some of the family hates each other at least they don’t speak to each other and sometims you cant menshun there names. So what, I can invite them.

You want to organize a family reunion. Describe the steps you will take to contact people and to organize the event.,6,"When Maria Mariella Panontin ﬁrst showed up at our school, here’s what I thought: Look at that girl. She dresses like she’s some exotic gypsy or something. Looks like a real high-maintenance kind of girl. Not my type; I’m not going to103  bother trying to get to know her.” So I didn’t. Too late, I realized what a mis- take I’d made.Maria Mariella (she went by both names) was a foreign exchange student from Italy who was staying with a friend of mine, Joanne. Joanne and I weren’t that close, but we hung out in the same general crowd, so when the extended clique got together, Maria Mariella was often part of the group. We were friendly to each other, but we never tried to become friends until Shanda’s party.I wasn’t planning on going to Shanda’s party because I had a big track meet the next day, but my friend Elaine convinced me to go for a little while. When I was saying goodbye, Joanne rushed up to me.“Hey, Jenine, can you do me a really big favor? Maria Mariella needs to go home, but I want to stay. Would you mind dropping her off at my house?”I didn’t really want to, but it was on the way, and I would have looked like a real jerk if I said no, so I said, “Sure, no problem.” Maria Mariella was right behind Joanne. I looked at her and said, “Let’s go.”We hopped into my car. As I was pulling out of the driveway, I popped in a 10,000 Maniacs cassette and turned the radio up loud.“I love this song!” Maria Mariella shouted over the music.“Really?” Not even my American friends appreciated this band. “You like the 10,000 Maniacs?”“I love them,” she said with her heavy Italian accent.After that, it seemed like Maria Mariella and I couldn’t stop talking to one another and ﬁnding things in common. I loved that she was straight- forward and honest, like me. She shared my taste in music and ﬁlm. We both had crushes on the same movie stars. It felt like a friendship that was meant to be.Then, just two weeks later, Maria Mariella threw a party at Joanne’s house. It was a going away party. Her mother had developed a serious ill- ness, and Maria Mariella was going home to be with her. At that party, a group of us were playing Truth or Dare, one of our favorite games. It was Maria Mariella’s turn.“Truth!” she said.“Name something you regret,” our friend Denise demanded.Maria Mariella pointed a long ﬁnger at me. “I wish I’d taken the time to get to know you sooner. I didn’t think you were worth my time.”A sad smile came across my face. “I thought the same thing, Maria Mariella,” I said. “That is something I’m always going to regret.”104  "

I learned my lesson about this in high school when I met Maria Mariella. I didn’t think she was worth getting to know but I was very wrong. She turned out to be a great friend, but by the time I realized it she was gone. Maria Mariella came to our school from Italy, she stayed with a friend of mine, Joanne. I saw Maria Mariella a lot at school and parties but I never really talked to her. Just from how she looked and dressed (like a gypsy), I didn’t think I’d like her. Then one night Joanne asked me to take Maria Mariella home because I was leaving early and she wanted to leave early too. So I did, and I found out she loved the 10,000 Maniacs as much as I did, not even my best friend liked the same music. After that we started talking and hanging out, and we kept ﬁnding that we had all kinds of things in common.The more we talked, the more we liked each other.Its a sad thing that our friendship was so short. Maria Mariella had to go back to Italy a few weeks later because her mother got sick. At her good- bye party, we were playing “Truth or Dare.” It was our favorite game. When it was Maria Mariella’s turn she said “truth.” Denise asked her to tell the truth about something she regrets.Maria Mariella said, “I wish I’d gotten to know you sooner, I didn’t think you were worth my time.” I said, me too, and that’s something we both regret."

It has been said that the truth is often stranger than ﬁction. Describe an experience you had that was so strange others might think you made it up.,6,"My friends still think I made this story up, even though they’ve never known me to be a liar. When it happened I couldn’t believe it myself, but it’s true. This really happened.My best friend and I were working one summer as line chefs in the Mar- riott at the sprawling TanTara Resort on the Lake of the Ozarks, Missouri. One Tuesday morning, as I walked through the kitchen to get to the time clock, half a dozen people said to me, “Uh-oh, man, the executive chef wants to see you.” The executive chef? But I hadn’t done anything wrong. What could he want? Why was I in trouble?I clocked in and knocked on the executive chef’s door. “Listen,” he said angrily when I sat down, “I don’t know what you guys did or how you did it, but you and your buddy Jim have off on Friday.” Friday was our busiest night; no one gets off on Friday without a very good reason. “Just one thing,” he said sternly as I got up to go, “Don’t you guys tell anyone why you’re not coming in. Understand?”“Understand,” I replied, but I had no idea what he was talking about. I had to ﬁnd Jim as soon as possible and ﬁgure out what was going on. But every time I asked Jim about it, he simply said, “I’ll tell you later. Just don’t worry about it.” No matter how much I begged, he wouldn’t tell me what was going on and why we had the day off. By Thursday night, he still hadn’t told me what was happening Friday. As we were watching TV in our apart- ment, he said, “Let’s hit the sack early tonight. We’re going to need lots of rest for tomorrow.” Jim never went to bed early. What on earth was going on?In the morning, Jim woke me up (another anomaly) and told me to get a quick shower, put on my bathing suit, and pack a change of clothes. A few minutes later, a dark SUV with tinted windows pulled up in front of our building. “There’s our ride,” Jim said with a secretive smile. We walked out to the car, but I wasn’t getting in without an explanation. So Jim shoved me in. Inside, I looked up, and there in the passenger seat was	.Now Jim had no choice but to explain. It turns out that a friend of a friend of Jim’s knew	and knew that	wanted to get away for a totally private vacation between ﬁlms. This friend said that he knew two guys at a large secluded lake in Missouri who would “take care of him.” So 	 called the executive chef and asked for me and Jim to have the day off. We spent the day out on the lake with	, water-skiing, ﬁshing, eat- ing, drinking, and telling stories. We did our best to treat him like just another guy spending the day with a couple of new friends. We didn’t ask106  him anything about Hollywood or his latest high-proﬁle romance; we just let him relax and be himself for a day without cameras or fans.At the end of the day, as we pulled back into the dock, he said, “Listen, guys, I had a really good time today. It was just what I needed. I appreciate it, man.” He shook our hands. “One favor, though?” he asked. “Don’t tell anybody about this. If people ﬁnd out I’m here, I won’t get any peace and quiet. I need some time alone.”“No problem,” we said, and headed home. The next day, everyone kept asking what was so special that we had to have Friday off. The night was a disaster for the kitchen, and they were all upset that we hadn’t been there. All we could say was, “Nothing, man, nothing. We were just hanging out.” We had a great time, too, and we kept our promise."
It has been said that the truth is often stranger than ﬁction. Describe an experience you had that was so strange others might think you made it up.,4,"My friends still don’t believe me when I tell them this story, but its true. I was working in a restaurant at a big lake resort, in Missouri, when my boss called me into his ofﬁce. I thought I was in trouble. Instead, he told me that me and my roommate and best friend, Jim, had Friday off. Normally you have to beg and plead or have an emergency to have a Friday off, here I was getting the day off without even asking. I had no idea what was going on. He seems angry, too, and says, “don’t you and your friend tell anybody why your not coming in Friday, understand”? I said yes, but I was clueless.I kept asking my roommate about it but he decides not to tell me any- thing. “Just don’t worry,” he keeps saying, and it was starting to drive me crazy. For three days, he kept the secret. Then, Friday morning, he wakes me up early (I’m always the one up ﬁrst, so I thought this was really weird) and tells me to get dressed. A few minutes later, a black SUV with dark win- dows pulls up, and he tells me to get in. No way, I say, but he pushes me in, and that’s when I see whose in the car,	.“What is going on?” I demand so I ﬁnally get my explanation. A friend of a friend of Jim heard that	needed a vacation between movies, told him to go to this lake which is pretty private because its really big, you can hide away there if you want. He also gave	our names and said we would take care of him for the day if he wanted, so he called our boss and told him to give us the day off. We went out on the lake then and spent the day out on the boat.It turns out that	was a really cool guy. It was hard to treat him like just another guy, but we did, because that was what he wanted. We didn’t ask him about his movies or anything, actually he kept asking us questions107  about us. We all had a great time. At the end of the day, he thanks us and asks us not to tell anyone so that people don’t chase him with cameras and stuff. We promised. It was so hard not to tell anyone what we did that day!"

But we’re not aloud to tell any body any thing. That was so frustrating! For me.This guy he was a really good actor, I seen him in a lot of ﬁlms, I was like wow when I met him but I have to play it cool, like I don’t care how famous he is. That was so hard. We hung out all day and he was a really nice guy to. He was glad noone else knows that he is there on the lake or else they all come after him with cameras and stuff and bother him a lot."

Tell about a time when you had to face one of your greatest fears.",6,"Every kid in the neighborhood knew the Robinson house and avoided it like a bowl of Brussels sprouts. Mr. Robinson was a notorious crank, the house was always dark and creepy, and his dog was a terror—a mean, fang-toothed creature that looked like she would love to tear you apart.The dog’s name was Angel, but she scared the devil out of us. She was half pit bull, half Doberman pinscher. Mr. Robinson kept her out on the front lawn, chained to a thin pole stuck in the ground near his front door. It was a long chain, and when I walked past the house to the bus stop, Angel always bounded toward me, barking furiously. One of these times that chain will break, I thought, and I’ll be Angel’s dinner. When I got to the Robinson house, I always walked past it as quickly as I could. Sometimes I could see Mr. Robinson watching from the window, laughing.Then it happened. We had gotten our report cards in school that day, and I was so proud of my marks and my teachers’ comments that I just had to look at them again on my way home from the bus stop. I was so wrapped up in that report card that I didn’t realize how close I was to Mr. Robinson’s108  house, and Angel startled me when she started barking. I dropped my report card, and just then, a big gust of wind took the paper up into the air. It landed right smack in the middle of Mr. Robinson’s lawn, about two feet away from Angel.Angel, growling ferociously, was straining her chain, trying to get closer to me. I could see her long canines. I could even smell her from where I was standing. I think I was shaking. But I needed to get that report card back. My mom had to sign it. Besides, she had to see those fantastic grades.I thought about yelling for Mr. Robinson, but I was just as afraid of him as of the dog. So I decided to see if maybe, just maybe, Angel would let me get close enough to get that piece of paper.I remembered my uncle telling me that dogs can sense your fear, and that most dogs will be friendly if you approach them in the right manner. So I did my best not to look scared. I straightened up, softened my face, and walked slowly toward Angel. She kept barking and growling. Saliva was dripping from her chin. I closed my eyes and gulped. I was about six feet away from Angel, and I put my ﬁst out in front of me for her to smell, say- ing, “Here, girl. Nice girl. Good girl,” as calmly as I could. But she was barking so loudly and angrily that I’m sure she didn’t hear a word.Inside, I had never been more frightened. This dog is going to tear me to pieces, I thought. But I kept going, slowly. I had never earned such good marks before. I wasn’t going to let a crazy old dog keep me from showing that report card to my parents.I was about three steps away from Angel when the wind blew again, this time sending my report card just out of Angel’s reach. I didn’t have to con- front that dog after all. It was a good thing, too—Mr. Robinson later told my folks that Angel surely would have bitten me badly. I realized that what I’d planned to do was dangerous and that I was simply being stub- born. But part of me was proud, because I was brave enough to try to get close to Angel."

He was as creepy as she was mean.One day we got our report cards and I saw I’d gotten the best grades ever. I couldn’t wait to show my parents. On my way home, passing the Robin-109  sons house, I was looking at my report card again. I was just so proud. But then Angel started to bark, and that scared me. I dropped my report card, and some wind came along and blew it right next to Angel.Angel was pulling on her chain and growling at me, scaring me to death. But, I had to get my report card back. What was I going to do? I decided to try to make friends with Angel. I know that if you hold your hand out to a dog and don’t act scared they’ll often be friendly to you because then they don’t fell threatened. So, I slowly approached Angel trying not to look to scared. I thought she was going to attack me, but I kept going slowly towards her.Luckily, just then the wind blew again. This time my report card blew towards me and far enough away from Angel that I could get it safely. I breathed a big sigh of relief and headed home. Later Mr. Robinson told my parents that Angel surely would have bitten me. It’s a good thing I didn’t get any closer. Still I’m proud that I got as close as I did."

My report card blue out of my hands next to Angel. I was really scared, more then ever. I got close and then the wind blue again, luckily for me. She just kept barking and growling all the time, too.

Moving can be a very exciting but also difﬁcult time in one’s life. Tell about a time you moved and how it affected you.,6,"As the new kid in town, I was eager—ok, desperate—to make new friends, and fast. My dad had just accepted a promotion that required a transfer, and we moved from Chicago to Oakland, California, just a few days before I was to begin the sixth grade. I didn’t even have a chance to get to know any of the kids in the neighborhood.After the ﬁrst day of school, I could tell that Charlie Jenkins was the one who would make me or break me. He was a bully for sure, but he was so good-looking and charming that everyone seemed to like him. He was clearly the center of power in that classroom, and I knew I would have to win his approval. I just wasn’t sure what I’d have to do to get it.110  My answer came at the end of the third week of school, when Ms. Har- court gave us our second writing assignment. We’d been reading and dis- cussing fables, and now it was our turn to write our own. That afternoon, Charlie cornered me on the playground.He teased me about being a new kid, yet he seemed interested in the fact that I was a good writer. Our teacher, Ms. Harcourt had read aloud one of my poems in class just yesterday, and obviously he was paying attention. I admitted that I had a ﬂair for writing, and at ﬁrst I was ﬂattered that he noticed. But, he had an ulterior motive.“Hey, new kid, hold on a second,” he said, standing between the gate and me. “You seem to be pretty good with writing.”“Yeah, you do alright, alright,” he replied. “I’ll tell you what,” he said, moving closer, until his face was just a few inches from mine. “Why don’t you just write an extra fable, one for you, one for me? Let me see what you can do.”So that was it. I was going to do Charlie’s English homework for him.That was the price I was going to pay to be accepted.Charlie didn’t wait for an answer. “Bring two fables to school on Mon- day,” he said. That would give him time to copy it over into his own hand- writing to submit to Ms. Harcourt on Tuesday.Over the weekend, I wrote two fables, both of them quite good, I thought, but one was deﬁnitely better than the other. On Monday morn- ing, I met Charlie in the schoolyard as planned.“Here’s your fable,” I said to Charlie, handing him a piece of paper. I gave Charlie the fable that I thought was inferior, keeping the better fable for myself, and turned to walk away.He questioned me about the quality of the paper, read it quickly, and decided that it passed muster. Without saying thank you or goodbye, he swaggered off into the building.A few days later, Ms. Harcourt returned our fables. I looked at my paper, expecting to see an A or A+, but my grade was an A-. Then I looked over at Charlie. He was holding his paper up high so I could see his grade: A+. I knew the fable I’d kept for myself was better. Perhaps Charlie’s charm was factored into his grade.Fortunately, I only had to do one more assignment for Charlie before he and his family abruptly moved to another town. Now Charlie was going to be the new kid in the classroom. I often wondered what he had to do there to be accepted.111  "
Moving can be a very exciting but also difﬁcult time in one’s life. Tell about a time you moved and how it affected you.,4,"One of the hardest things about moving is trying to make new friends. When we moved to Oakland, I didn’t have time to make any friends before school started. I was the “new” kid in the classroom. The most popular kid in the sixth grade was Charlie, and I had to make sure he liked me. I could tell right away you wouldn’t want Charlie as your enemy.After a couple weeks of school, we were given an assignment in English, we had to write our own fables. (We’d been studying fables in class). Char- lie came up to me in the playground that day. He’d found out I was a good writer, and he said I better write an extra fable for him. If I wanted Charlie to like me, I was going to have to do his English homework for him. “Meet me here Monday before school starts, with my fable,” he said.So I wrote two fables that weekend. Both of them were good, but one was better than the other. That’s the one I kept for myself. I gave the other one to Charlie, outside of school on Monday morning, just like he said. He made me stand there while he read it to make sure it was good. He seemed to like it, and he let me go.A few days later we get our fables back, and I couldn’t believe it. Char- lie got an A+ on his fable while I got an A-. I know my fable was better than his (which was really mine, of course). Maybe the teacher really liked Char- lie. That’s the only way I can explain it.A few weeks later Charlie’s family had to move, so I only had to do one more assignment for him. Now he had to be the new kid. I wonder how he handled it."

This was not fare at all. I think the teacher had a big problem. Sometimes the popular kids are even poplar with teech- ers, they get better grades for nothing. This made me very angry.I was very happy when he moved away then I didn’t have to do any more work for him or worry if he likes me.112  "
"As the saying goes, “If at ﬁrst you don’t succeed, try, try again.” Describe a time when you persisted until you achieved your goal.",6,"In seventh grade, I had a best friend who was an incredible athlete. I was pretty coordinated myself, but because I was so insecure, I never seemed to be any good at sports. I was so afraid of missing the ball that I would be sure to swing and miss, even if it was right over the plate. But Katie was my best friend, and if she joined a team, I did, too. Or at least I tried. Katie was a starter for the junior varsity ﬁeld hockey team; I sat on the bench all sea- son. Katie played regularly in JV basketball; I was cut during tryouts. I ﬁg- ured I was headed for a similar fate with lacrosse. But Katie was my best friend, so I signed up anyway.Katie was a natural, and she picked up the new sport quickly. I, on the other hand, couldn’t seem to hold the lacrosse stick comfortably. I caught one out of ten throws, if I was lucky, and my tosses were always way off their mark. I was clumsy and feeling clumsier, and I thought maybe it was time to give it up. But that would create an even wider gulf between Katie and me. Already she was spending more and more time with the girls who, like her, excelled at sports. I was beginning to be left behind.Determined to stick it out and save our friendship, I begged my mom to take me to a sporting goods store and buy me an early birthday present: my own lacrosse stick and ball so I could practice at home. Katie was impressed with my stick, but I could tell that she thought it was a waste of money. She ﬁgured I would never get to use that stick in a game.I was hurt by her reaction, and again I felt the distance between us. If I was going to keep Katie as a friend, I thought, I simply had to get the hang of this sport. It was my last chance. Somehow, someway, I had to learn how to throw and catch the ball in that net and be respectable on the playing ﬁeld.So I practiced, and I practiced, and I practiced some more. I often felt like there was no hope, and I broke two windows in the garage, but I kept at it.Then, one day, just after the ﬁrst ofﬁcial game of the season (during which I sat on the bench), something happened. I paired off with Suzie, who had become my partner since Katie had quickly proven to be too good to play with me. That day, when Suzi sent me her ﬁrst throw, I caught it. When I threw the ball back to her, I hit her stick dead on. I caught her next throw, and the next. Something was happening. I was getting it. The stick was actually feeling good in my hands. The movements were becoming nat- ural. I was catching and throwing the ball accurately.I still don’t know what exactly happened that day, but I will always be113  grateful for it. By the end of the season, I was starting for the JV team. I scored 12 goals that year, and the next year I was playing varsity. My suc- cess on the ﬁeld gave me conﬁdence that I desperately needed. Katie and I continued to drift apart, but Suzie turned out to be a great friend. She quit after the ﬁrst year, but she came to every game to cheer me on."

When I was in Junior High School, I tried many sports because my best friend did. She was a great athlete; I was not. I sat on the bench all of ﬁeld hockey season and I got cut during basketball tryouts, too. I stuck with it, though and ﬁnally made it on the lacrosse team.My friend Katie picked up lacrosse right away, but I struggled. Even though she was my best friend I couldn’t be partners with her during prac- tice. Because she was so much better than me. I was afraid that if I didn’t learn how to be good at lacrosse, our friendship would be over. She was spending more and more time with her sports friends, and I was feeling more and more left out.I decided to do something to save our friendship. I went out and bought a lacrosse stick. After practice, I’d come home and practice. I practiced on weekends, too. I tried and tried and tried. Some days I felt like there wasn’t any hope, but I kept trying.Then one day, it happened. I was throwing and catching the ball with Suzie, my new partner. Suddenly, I caught the ball. I caught the next one she threw, too. My throws to her were accurate. From that day on, I got better and better. I had more conﬁdence, too. I ended up playing a lot that season on the JV team and even scored 12 goals. Suzie quit the team, but she was my new friend, and she came to cheer me on. I’m really glad I kept trying."

When I ﬁrst start I was lousy at it. I couldnt catch or through the ball right. I was sitting on the bench all the time. My friend was really good at it. She even plays varsity her ﬁrst year.This friend shes looking for other friends who are like her good at sports not like me. She really hurt me a lot that way. However I make new friends114  like Suzie. She was my partner in practices. She stayed with me even when I learned how to play right."
Movies and literature often deal with the theme of “counting your blessings.” Tell about an experience that led you to appreciate someone or something you’d taken for granted.,6,"I often complained about our lack of wealth to my parents, who often replied that I had no idea what it means to be poor and that someday they’d show me what poverty was really like. I thought they were all talk, but one day, they proved me wrong—and showed me just how right they were, and they said I would see.I did see, and the images from that day still haunt me. My parents were very active in their church, and they had arranged to deliver clothing and food donations to a church in a deeply impoverished area on the edge of the Appalachian Mountains, a four-hour drive from our home.I’d seen pictures of poverty before, of course. But seeing a picture of a shack with seven malnourished children and actually walking into such a shack are two entirely different things. The pastor of the church took us into a few homes so we could deliver some of the items (a crib, a box of linens, canned goods) personally. I had never felt so uncomfortable before. These people had so little! Eight family members living in two rooms . . . no electricity or running water . . . no couches or microwaves or cable tel- evision . . . soon I began to realize just how lucky I was. True, I didn’t have as much as my friends. But I had so much more than the people we visited that day. I felt greedy and guilty for having so many things.When we got back home, I got on the Internet and found a soup kitchen not too far from our home. I’ve been volunteering there twice a week ever since. Two of my friends have joined me. Every time we go, we count our blessings."

We lived in a very rich neighborhood but we ourselves were not rich, we were only middle class. Therefore I always felt like I was poor; compared to all my friends and their fancy houses and pools and cars. None of my friends had to work; but I had to work, to afford my car.I guess my parents got tired, of me complaining, so one day they woke115  me up really early and took me on a long drive to a really poor neighbor- hood. I mean this place was really, really poor. I never saw such poverty before. The people, they lived in shacks, not houses. Everything was dirty, they had nothing like we have in our houses, most of them didn’t even have running water or even electricity. And so many people living in such a lit- tle shack, with everyone on top of each other.We went there to deliver some food and clothing donations to a church. The paster, he took us to some houses to deliver some of the food and clothes ourselves. Thus, I could see for myself how much I really had.When I got back home, I found a soup kitchen I could go to help other people who really don’t have anything, not even food to eat. They always remind me to count my blessings."

Many movies and books are about this. I am sure you have seen some and read some. Like scary movies where people get killed can make us apreciate the blessing, we are still alive. Or a war movie, that were not ﬁghting a war. When I went to a poor town once when I was in school I saw people even more poor than me. That made me sad, they live with so little. Compared to how much I have. All the time I felt poor since my friends, they were so rich."
"We are often surprised, even awed, by the experiences of our ancestors. Describe a time when you learned something important about your family history.",6,"My dad wasn’t the type to talk much about anything, and he was especially quiet about his past. There were a few things I knew: He’d come over from Hungary in 1956, after the Revolution. He’d fought with the rebels in Budapest. He was a toolmaker in Hungary, and he was a toolmaker here. He left behind his parents and 11 brothers and sisters, who still lived in the coun- tryside. They exchanged letters once or twice a year. That was about all I knew.The summer that I was fourteen, my dad received one of those letters. In it was the news that one of his brothers had died. Maybe it was the realiza- tion that he was so out of touch with his family. Maybe it was his own mor- tality he was facing. In any case, a few days after the letter came, he told me about his role in the Hungarian Revolution and his escape from Hungary.116  The Hungarian Revolution began with a massive student protest on October 23, 1956, and ended just a few weeks later in November after the city was invaded by Soviet tanks and the rebellion crushed. My dad, just 22 years old, had decided to join the students who were protesting the Com- munist regime, and soon he was not just a protester but a soldier, and not just a soldier but an ofﬁcer in the rebel army. “Wait a minute,” he said, and he returned with a tattered copy of LIFE magazine’s special issue devoted to the Hungarian Revolution. He ﬂipped through the pages, showing me image after image of buildings demolished by bombs, rebels ﬁghting on foot against tanks, bodies lying in the street. Then he found the picture he was looking for. “There,” he said, pointing to a window in an abandoned, bullet-ridden building. “I was hiding in there, throwing Malotov cocktails at the Russian tanks.”It’s a long and fascinating story, and I wanted to know all the details. How did he get involved? How did he escape? How close was he to being cap- tured or killed? I had so many questions. But the question I wanted answered most was this: Why did he ﬁght? At that age, I was just starting to ﬁnd my footing in the swampy ground of ethics and moral stances. I was having a tough time ﬁguring out what I believed in, and I wanted desper- ately to understand how someone could believe in something so strongly that he would be willing to die for it.Why did he do it? There were a lot of reasons, he said. For one thing, the Communist regime was ruining the economy. As a toolmaker with sev- eral years of experience, he had a better salary than most, but still, he said, “I couldn’t afford both clothes and food.” If he respected the government, he would have been able to live with that. “But what I couldn’t live with,” he said, “was not being able to say what I wanted. The Communists, they had all kinds of restrictions on everything. You couldn’t go to the next town without the proper permissions and papers. And you couldn’t say anything, not anything, against the government, or else they’d put you in jail, or worse. They’d come and get you late at night and no one in your family would ever see you again.” That’s what happened to his best friend, Attila. He disap- peared the night of September 22, and no one ever heard from him again. My dad often complains about America. The politicians are crooks, crim- inals have too many rights, schools and parents aren’t strict enough with children, and the taxes are “an abomination.” But I don’t need to remindhim that at least in this country, he can complain as loudly as he pleases.117  "

Describe a time when you learned something important about your family history.",4,"The summer I was fourteen, I learned something about my dad. He never talked much and I didn’t really know that much about him. After he found out about his brother dying back in Hungary, he must’ve felt like it was important for me to know more. He decided it was time to tell me about the Hungarian Revolution.My dad was a toolmaker in Hungary. Because he didn’t like the Com- munist government, he decided to join the protests led by students angry at the government. That’s how the rebellion started. The communists wouldn’t let anyone talk bad about the government, and the protesters were attacked. That started the ﬁghting. He showed me pictures of the revolu- tion with lots of destroyed buildings and people lying in the street. It was horrible. Because he was a little older than most of the students, my dad became an ofﬁcer in the rebel army.I wanted to know why he decided to ﬁght. He told me that because of the communist government, he couldn’t make enough money to buy food and clothes. He couldn’t travel to another town without the right papers. The most important thing, though, was freedom of speech. He couldn’t say what he wanted. He said that anyone who criticized the government would get taken away in the middle of the night and no one would see them again. That happened to his best friend. For my dad, that was the last straw.My dad escaped with the other refugees, and he’s been living in Amer- ica ever since 1956. He complains about America a lot, especially the politi- cians. But he knows that here, no one is going to come and take him away for that."

He didn’t like to talk much so thats part of why I was so surprized.One question I had, was, why did he ﬁght. He said he didn’t like the gov- ernment and they’d take you away just for saying that. I can’t imagine such a thing. I’d want to ﬁght to. That’s not the way it is here in America. This is a really grate country and I’m glad to live here.118  "
Most of us remember exactly where we were and what we were doing when we received shocking or important news. Tell the story of what you were doing when you heard about an important event and how that news affected you.,6,"Every May the carnival came to town. It was the standard small-town fair: a ferris wheel, a fun house, a giant slide, and dozens of booths where you could buy greasy food and try to win cheap stuffed animals for your date.That’s where I was, with my date—sort of. We weren’t actually in the fairgrounds. We were in his car in the parking lot, stealing some time together. I was 16, but I wasn’t allowed to date, and I had the sort of father who just might come to the fair to check up on me to make sure I wasn’t hanging out with any boys.Keith had borrowed his mom’s Buick Skylark, as usual. REO Speed- wagon’s “I Can’t Fight This Feeling” was playing on the radio when Keith rather abruptly ended a kiss, interrupting what I thought had been a per- fectly nice romantic moment.“I have something to tell you,” he said. He wouldn’t look me in the eye. My heart dropped to the ﬂoor. He’s going to break up with me, I thought in horror.But that’s not what happened. In fact, I never could have guessed at what Keith was about to tell me.He took a deep breath and looked straight ahead at the windshield. “Your mom was married to someone else before she married your dad,” he said softly. “You have an older brother. He lives in North Carolina.”I know what you’re thinking, because it’s exactly what I was wondering, too:How on Earth did Keith know this? He guessed what I was thinking, and said: “My mom told me.” Then, before I could ask, he added: “Edie told her.”Edie was his mother’s hairdresser.Finding out that I had an older brother was a shock enough. To ﬁnd out from my boyfriend, who found out from his mother, who found out from her hairdresser—that was just too much. I was too overwhelmed to respond. After a few minutes of silence during which Keith held my hand, what Keith told me about how he found out began to make sense. Edie was the daughter of my dad’s best friend, Samuel. Though our families were no longer close, when I was young, we spent a lot of time together. Edie and her older sister used to babysit my sister and me. It wouldn’t be so unlikelyfor her to pick up a family secret or two.119  Keith’s mom had told him what Edie told her because she believed it was proof that I wasn’t good enough to be his girlfriend. He wanted me to know about my brother, of course, but he also wanted me to know that he was going to have to cool it for a while until his mom got over it.The next day, I told my mom that I knew about my brother. At ﬁrst, she looked shocked; then she looked relieved, as if a tremendous burden had been lifted. She was glad I knew, although she was sorry about the way in which I’d found out. She gave me my brother’s phone number and told me I could call whenever I was ready.Today, my brother and I talk regularly, and he is one of my closest friends. One of these days, I have to thank Edie for being such a gossip."

You could also buy lots of food. I enjoyed the fair, but this time I wasn’t going on any rides. I was sitting with my boyfriend in his car in the parking lot.I wasn’t suppose to have a boyfriend. That’s why we were hiding in his car. We were listening to music and talking and kissing. Suddenly Keith stopped. He said he had something to tell me. I got really scared. Is he going to break up with me, I wondered?That’s what I thought was going to happen. But he surprised me even more.“You have an older brother,” Keith told me. I was shocked. He told me that my mother had been married before she met my dad. I never knew this, and I wondered how on earth Keith knew this if I didn’t even know. I asked him, and he said, “My mom told me.”How on earth did his mom know, I demanded. It turns out her hair- dresser, of all people told her. I was confused. But then I remember her hair dresser is Edie, who used to babysit us when we were little. Edie’s dad and my dad were best friends a long time ago. Maybe that’s how Edie found out. She must have heard them talking about it one time.I was very upset that Keith knew something my parents hid from me. His mom told him because she wants him to break up with me. She was think- ing our family is bad because of this. Plus he wanted me to know about my older brother. Well, the next morning I talked to my mom, and she gives me my brothers number. She says sorry for not telling me earlier, and now me and my brother we are very good friends. I am glad Edie liked to gossip.120  "

Many things can interfere with our plans. Sometimes an illness prevents us from doing something we really want to do. Describe a time when you became ill and missed out on doing something you’d really been looking forward to.,6,"I’d been looking forward to my 12th birthday for months. We were going to have a party in school and a party at my house after school. My relatives from Ohio were coming, my mom was going to bake my favorite cake, and my brother and his friends were going to DJ. I spent weeks making up the play list, though I might as well have just handed over my pile of Beach Boys albums, because just about every song I chose was a Beach Boys tune. I was the biggest Beach Boys fan on the East coast.The day before my birthday, however, I came down with the chicken pox. Everything for the next day was cancelled, and I stayed home from school, itchy and cranky. I refused to get out of my pajamas or be civil to anyone. I just sat in my room, playing my Beach Boys albums and feeling miserable. The next day, my birthday, I was still itchy and cranky as can be, a total wretch. Until HE called.Just after lunch and my third “Three Stooges” episode, the phone rang. It was my dad telling me I had to believe his next statement. I rolled my eyes but agreed.“In a few minutes, Brian Wilson is going to call you,” he said. “That’s not funny, Dad,” I replied.He assured me that it would happen and hung up. He told me I had to believe him and to answer the phone when it rang.121  Was he playing a joke on me? No, he couldn’t be. My dad knew how much I loved the Beach Boys, and to play a joke of this sort would be too cruel. He must be serious, I thought, but I couldn’t believe it.“Okay,” I said to myself as I placed the receiver down. The Brian Wilson was going to call me? I sat in a daze. Then, before I had a chance to digest what my father said, the phone rang. I thought it was my dad calling back to say he was just teasing. It wasn’t.At the other end of the line was none other than the Brian Wilson. I don’t really remember what he said beyond that; once I realized it really was Brian Wilson, I went into a mild state of shock. He must have thought I was a ter- rible conversationalist because I could only say “yeah” or “no” to most of his questions. After a few minutes, he said goodbye. I hung up the phone, screamed, and cried."

Many of our fondest memories are associated with food. Describe a memorable experience that took place while preparing or eating food.,6,"Back when I was in junior high school, all students—boys as well as girls— were required to take home economics. In the fall, we sewed duffel bags and pillows shaped like animals. In the spring, we learned how to cook.For our ﬁnal cooking class project, we had to cook a dish at home and bring it to class. I knew right away what I was going to make: my Aunt Rosie’s famous chocolate cake.My aunt Rosie made the best chocolate cake in the world. It was a recipe she had gotten from her grandmother, who swore her grandmother had personally made that chocolate cake for the Prince of Wales. When I started the cooking class, I had asked Aunt Rosie what made her chocolate cake so special. She told me the secret ingredient was coffee.I had never tried to bake a cake from scratch before, and since the choco- late cake was Aunt Rosie’s specialty, I thought for sure she would help me make it.“But that would be cheating,” she said as a she handed me the recipe. “You go home and you make it yourself. Make sure you save a piece for me!” she hollered as I headed out the door.At home, I got out my ingredients: eggs, butter, milk, sugar, ﬁne pow- dered chocolate, cinnamon, baking powder, and coffee. The recipe looked easy enough, and I followed each step carefully. When I had mixed every- thing together, I carefully poured the batter into the pan. I put the cake into the oven, which I had preheated as directed, and set a timer for 50 minutes. When the buzzer went off, I stuck a toothpick into the middle of the cake to make sure it was done. It was perfect.When the cake cooled, I opened up a can of Betty Crocker’s chocolate123  frosting, spread a thick layer on top of the cake, and covered it with plastic wrap. It was a masterpiece, and I couldn’t wait for my classmates to taste it. The next morning, I carried my cake carefully to school. I passed out pieces to my classmates, beaming with pride. But when I saw the look on their faces, I knew something was terribly wrong. I took a bite and nearly burst into tears. No wonder they looked disgusted! Aunt Rosie’s cake was never crunchy, and the crunchy things were bitter. The cake tasted awful. My heart sank as I watched Mrs. Wilson take a bite. She crunched, paused,crunched again, paused again, and looked at me thoughtfully.“Sarah,” she said gently, “does the recipe for this cake call for coffee?” “Yes,” I replied.“Hmmm. I thought so.”When I questioned her about my mistake, she said, “You used coffee grounds. You were supposed to use liquid coffee,” she said, and she laughed gently.I was mortiﬁed. I vowed to correct my mistake and make a new cake for tomorrow.This time, with a real cup of coffee, I baked a cake that would have made Aunt Rosie proud."
Many of our fondest memories are associated with food. Describe a memorable experience that took place while preparing or eating food.,4,"One of my most memorable school experiences had to do with food prepa- ration. I was making a cake for my cooking class in junior high school, but things didn’t turn out the way I’d planned.We all had to make something at home for our ﬁnal cooking project, and I wanted to make my Aunt Rosie’s famous chocolate cake. She made the best chocolate cake in the world, all of my family and friends agreed. It was an easy enough recipe, I thought. What made it different—better than— most chocolate cakes was its secret ingredient, coffee.When I had all of the ingredients out I started making the cake. I fol- lowed the recipe exactly, putting in three-quarters cup of coffee, just like the recipe called for. I put it in the oven at precisely 350 degrees and cooked it for exactly one hour. When I took it out of the oven, it looked beautiful. I covered it with some chocolate frosting and set it aside to take to school in the morning. I was so proud of it!When I got to cooking class, however, I realized something was wrong. People made funny faces when they bit into the cake. So I tried it too, and it tasted awful. It was bitter and crunchy. Aunt Rosie’s cake never tasted like this! What did I do wrong?124  My teacher asked me if the recipe called for coffee. Yes, I told her. “You used coffee grounds, didn’t you,” she asked.“Yes,” I answered.That was my mistake. I was supposed to use brewed coffee, not coffee grounds. Mrs. Wilson was really nice, though; she allowed me to make another cake for the next class and bring it in. That time, I did it right. My cake was delicious. It would have made Aunt Rosie proud!"

"Try as we might to avoid them, accidents happen. Tell about a time when you were involved in an accident.",6,"I was never one to believe in things like miracles or fate, but since my acci- dent a few months ago, I look at things a little differently. Whether it was a miracle, or fate, or just plain luck, I’m still here to tell this story.It was a Monday morning, just about 8:15. I was actually a little early for once and was glad I didn’t have to race to work. It was my second week as a bank teller at Harrison Savings and Loan.There had been some freezing rain earlier that morning, but the roads seemed clear as I pulled out of the driveway. I turned left at the light, right at the Dunkin Donuts, and then left again onto the onramp for Route 61. I sped up to merge with the oncoming rush-hour trafﬁc when suddenly I felt my car, a brand new Durango, lose control. I’d hit a patch of ice.What happened next probably lasted no more than ﬁfteen seconds, but if felt like hours. I spun around like a top, turning two full revolutions as I crossed the two southbound lanes. Then I hit the median strip and the car ﬂipped over as it crossed into the northbound trafﬁc. I skidded across the highway and the car stopped in the right-hand lane. There I was, upside- down and backwards, after crashing across four lanes, and somehow I was alive. Somehow I hadn’t hit a single car.125  But I had no time to appreciate that miracle, because when I looked out the shattered windshield, I saw an 18-wheeler was bearing down upon me at about 65 miles an hour. There was no time to get out of the car.I screamed and braced myself for the impact. But instead of hearing the crunch of metal crashing into metal, I heard the screeching of brakes as the truck swerved around me, just in time to avoid a head-on collision. The truck skidded to a stop on the shoulder about a hundred feet away from me. Then the driver jumped out and ran over to see if I was okay.That night at home, I eased my aching body into bed. But I was climb- ing into my own bed, in my own room, not in the hospital. Somehow, the only injuries I sustained were a few cuts on my face and hands, a bruised right shoulder, and two bruised calf muscles. My new car was totaled, but I didn’t care. All that mattered was that I was alive."

It’s a miracle I didn’t get seriously hurt.When I hit the patch of ice, my car, my brand new Durango, that I was so proud of, lost control. I started spinning around like a top. I spun across the two north-bound lanes. Then my car hit the median strip and ﬂipped over.I thought, I ought to be dead already, but I wasn’t. But it wasn’t over yet. Now I went across the south bound lanes upsidedown. I stopped in the right hand lane and then I saw a big truck headed straight towards me.Somehow, I don’t know how, that truck managed to stop before it crashed into me. It swerved around me and saved my life. Then the driver got out to see if I was ok.Luckily, I was OK. I only had just a few cuts and bruises and I bruised both of my calf muscles.

The truck he stop on time and move around my car upsidedown still. He jump to see if I ok.In hospital doctors say I ok. Just many number of bruises and cuts and some on my calfs and shoulder. I am ok all thogh my car it ruined.
Describe an experience you had that would be considered a near miss or a brush with disaster.,6,"I must have had a guardian angel that day.I was six and had just learned how to ride a bicycle. My bike was a beauty: pink all over, with a stylish banana seat, iridescent fringes hanging off the handle bars, and a white woven basket with big, pink ﬂowers on the front. It was a Monday afternoon and I was alone, riding my bike in circles in the driveway. I was exalting in my freedom: no more training wheels, no more big brother or father pushing me from behind and holding me steady.Now I could start, stop, and ride all by myself, and I went around and around our circular driveway in complete bliss.The sun shone on my face and made the black pavement hot, even though it was already late September. Emboldened by the warmth of the sun and the excitement of my success—eight laps around and I hadn’t fallen yet—I decided it was time to leave the safety of the circle and ride down the steep hill that led to the road on which we lived: Route 309, a four-lane, heavily-traveled highway. I warmed up with another two or three turns around the circle and then eased to my right and down the slope.From the start of the circle to the edge of the highway, the driveway ran about 200 feet at an even 45 degrees. I began to pick up a lot of speed at 50 feet, more at 75, and by 100 feet I was ﬂying. The road was getting closer; I could see the faces of the people driving by at 50, 60, 70 miles an hour. It was time to slow down, but I couldn’t. I kept going faster, and faster, and I couldn’t stop. In my panic, I forgot how to use the brakes.In an instant I was out on the highway, a little pink streak that zoomed across all four lanes and somehow, someway, ended up on the other side, up on the Zeigler’s lawn, in one piece. In the seconds that it took me to cross the road, there had not been a single car. An instant later, they were back, and I had to wait several minutes before I slowly, shakily, walked my bike back across the street and up the driveway.I never told anyone about what happened, and it was a long, long time before I ventured down that slope again. When I did, I used my brakes the whole way down. This time, I wasn’t going to forget.127  "

I was six and just learned how to ride my bike by myself. I loved my bike. It was pink and had a banana seat and a basket in front.On the day that this happened, I was riding around in our driveway. Our driveway was a long hill and then a big circle at the top. I was riding around in the circle.It was the ﬁrst time I was all alone on my bike. After a while because I didn’t fall at all, I decided to go down the hill. I start down the slope and I realize I can’t remember how to break. This of course is a problem because I start going faster and faster, any minute I will be out on the highway.We lived on Route 309, a 4-lane highway that was always busy with cars. Suddenly I was zooming across that road. Somehow, I made it across all four lanes without getting hit by a car.I don’t know how I was so lucky, to not be hurt at all that day. Because a minute later, as soon as I was across, there were more cars on the road than I could count. Somehow, when I was going across, there just weren’t any cars. Maybe I had a guardian angel watching over me."

We all need help from others from time to time. Tell about a time you helped someone in need.,6,"It was the hottest day of the summer, a record-breaking 102 degrees, hot and humid, sweltering even in the shade. I was driving back from visiting my older brother and his new baby. In the blistering heat, I could see the blacktop bubbling. I’d never been so grateful for air conditioning before.I cruised happily along County Route 2, which wound through the northern tip of the Sonoran Desert. Then I saw that a car had broken down128  up ahead. It was the ﬁrst car I’d seen in about half an hour. In the distance, a few hundred feet ahead of the car, I saw a stooped ﬁgure walking with a gas can in his hands. There was nothing around for miles. There was no way this person was going to make it to the nearest town, which was a good twenty miles away, in this desert heat.I’d always been told to stay away from strangers, but I thought if there ever was a time to do a good deed, this was it. Besides, as I neared the ﬁg- ure, I could tell that it was an elderly man, and I thought there was little chance he’d do me any harm. So I slowed down and pulled over. “Need a lift?” I asked.Now that I could see him clearly, it was obvious the old man was already in trouble. He’d only walked a hundred yards or so, and he looked as if he was going to pass out any moment. “I’d be most grateful, young lady, if you could help me get to a gas station,” he said slowly. “I seem to be out of petroleum.”“No problem,” I replied. “I’m headed that way.”He climbed slowly into the car and I pulled back out onto the road. “Not a good day for car trouble, huh?” I asked.“Indeed,” he replied. He was silent for a few minutes while his body tem- perature normalized. I offered him a soda from the cooler I’d packed for my four-hour ride. He accepted it gratefully. We made a little small talk then, but just a little. He seemed to prefer the silence.As we neared the gas station, I asked him if he would like a ride back to his car. “I don’t have to be home until late this afternoon,” I told him. “It’s no trouble.”“I know it is quite out of your way,” he replied. “I would be most grate- ful.” He paused. “And just where is home, young lady?”“Elmwood,” I replied.I introduced myself as Emily Hampton and found out that he was Edward Gilliam. “By the way, my name is Emily. Emily Hampton.”“You’re a very kind lady, Ms. Hampton. My name is Edward Gilliam.”Edward ﬁlled up his gas can and I drove him back to his car. We ﬁlled up his tank, and I followed him back into town just to make sure he was ok. At the gas station, I beeped and waved and continued north towards home. Edward waved and nodded his thanks.The next morning, the doorbell rang. My mom answered. “Emily!” she hollered. “Get down here!” I came down the stairs and saw a giant bouquet of ﬂowers. They were stunning. A small note was attached:129  “Dearest Emily, thank you for your incredible kindness yesterday. You just might have saved my life, and I am eternally grateful. You reminded an old man of how much beauty there is in this world. Yours, Edward Gilliam.”"

But with that heat, how could I just drive by. It was the hottest day ever, I was driving through the desert when I passed a broken-down car. An old man was walking along the road carrying a gas can, I had to stop.I asked him if he needed a ride. Which was a silly question—of course he did. It was over 100 degrees and the nearest town was more than 20 miles away. He’d die before he made it ﬁve miles in those conditions.We didn’t talk much; I think he was the quiet type. I offered him a soda and he drank it down like that. When we got to the nearest gas station, I asked him, if he wanted me to drive him back to his car? “It won’t be any trouble,” I told him. I didn’t have to be home until the end of the day.So we ﬁlled up his gas can and I drove him back. We talked a little more this time. He asked where I lived, and he told me he was on his way to visit his granddaughter. We ﬁlled up his tank and I followed him for a while to make sure he was ok. Then I drove the rest of the way home.Next morning, the doorbell rang, there was a huge boquet of ﬂowers for me. They were from Edward (that was his name). He was very grateful; he said “I saved his life yesterday” and that “I reminded him there was so much beauty in the world.” I was so glad that I helped him."

"Tone is the mood or feeling the author intends the reader to experience. Using a speciﬁc piece of literature, explain how tone enhances the work.",6,"Writers for TV sitcoms or movies are fortunate. Visuals often convey tone much more conveniently than words. Writers have to be very skillful in word choice in order to evoke emotions. While I began to explore Edgar Allan Poe’s works, I was intrigued with the way Poe carefully chose lan- guage and with the way it evoked a very certain mood or tone.In Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart”, I was amazed with the way the main character could grow to hate someone’s physical appearance so much so that he could stare at him for hours on end. The plot of this story revolves around a young man who rents a room from an elderly man in a large, dark mansion. This is how Poe begins to create the tone or mood. If the setting were in a house with a white picket fence in Pleasantville, the setting might not be as effective for suspense or horror. However, Poe begins to master- fully build suspense in “The Tell-Tale Heart”. For example, the deranged tenant slowly opens the elderly man’s bedroom door at night and stares at his glass eye for hours in a seething rage. He does this numerous times, to where the reader begins to understand that this man is far from normal. His obsession leads him to commit a horrible crime.The rage this man feels about the eye ﬁnally comes to a point wherein he attacks the man and suffocates him in his bed. Afterwards, he dismem- bers his corpse and hides the pieces under the ﬂoorboards. By now, the reader is in complete disbelief and awe at such a heinous, non-provoked attack, that we must continue reading. The tone becomes very eerie, and will soon turn suspenseful.Finally, the police investigate the home after a neighbor reported hear- ing screams coming from the house. The deranged man invites the police in, and invites them to sit with him in the room where the corpse lies. Poe now adds to the tone with more suspense and a feeling of anxiety to whether the man will confess to the murder. While speaking with the police, the man begins to hear a faint heartbeat that continues to grow in volume. However, he is the only one who hears the noise. The man attempted to cunningly fool the police ofﬁcers while sitting on the corpse, only to now mentally break down from the noise inside his mind to where he confesses. The torture this man evokes on himself adds tremendously to the tone of the story.Just as Poe creates an eerie, intense, and twisted tone to his ﬁction, authors can lead their readers to feel certain emotions through their writing.146  "
"Tone is the mood or feeling the author intends the reader to experience. Using a speciﬁc piece of literature, explain how tone enhances the work.",4,"Tone can be called the way an author makes you feel while reading their work. I personally have been frightened, brought to tears, extremely angry, and have laughed out loud simply by the way an author creates the tone of a story. This is also very similar to what an audience experiences while watching a ﬁlm.I recall one work I read by Edgar Allen Poe called The Telltale Heart, which has a bizarre, twisted tone.Initially, I thought this story was simply about a man who takes in a stranger. However, the tone of the story became strange when the tenant stares at his landlord while he sleeps. Poe leads us into the mind of a madman. I was on the edge of my seat as the police were asking questions of the man. The tone of the story, or the mood, was both frightening and suspenseful.I enjoy reading all types of books because many times the tone is differ- ent. I especially like Poe’s stories because I now know how he used tone in his twisted tales."

"In the novel, The Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, a group of boys are stranded on a remote island to fend for themselves. Compare/contrast this novel to the popular television show Survivor. Use speciﬁc details in your answer.",6,"William Golding’s novel The Lord of the Flies explores many themes such as the dark side of human nature, allegiances, and how these boys mirror larger society. I feel as if the producers of the popular television show “Sur- vivor” used this novel as the framework of their show. Both Golding’s novel and the show have many similarities.When the show “Survivor” premiered, I immediately thought of the novel The Lord of the Flies. The novel is about a group of schoolboys who are ship- wrecked on a deserted island. The boys attempt to create a “civilization,” but147  ultimately transform into mere savages. This is an important novel for the psychological study Golding presents. One can’t help but draw parallels to adult society. There is a true need for structure and control in any society, but the means of that control makes this novel all the more interesting.One of the boys, Jack, is power-hungry and represents dictatorship. Some of the other boys such as Simon and Piggy try to do what is safe and conservative. The character of Ralph is symbolic of democracy and fairness. Throughout the novel, the boys engage in a power struggle and end up destroying one another. Golding’s use of symbolism forces the reader to see characters and situations as larger ideas. The boys realize that they must create some type of order.Similar to the television show “Survivor”, the boys hold council meet- ings, use objects as a symbol of strength, and use ﬁre as a symbol of hope. I remember watching the show and observing a contestant who won a phys- ical contest against the other players. This person was given a pillow to use, whereas the other contestants had nothing. The pillow symbolizes power, as did the conch in the novel. Also, whenever the show’s council met on Sunday nights, they all brought their torches. When someone was voted off the island (seen as a liability or risk to the welfare of the group), that per- son’s torch was extinguished, thus eliminating hope. Alliances were formed and these alliances pitted the contestants against each other. Ultimately the winner was the most cunning player who could convince the other mem- bers to follow them. This is exactly the situation that occurred between Ralph and Jack in the novel.William Golding’s novel allows the reader to explore human nature and mankind. Often, we do not like to face the psychological aspects of our being. “Survivor” emulates the same underlying motives that form our nature."

Use speciﬁc details in your answer.",4,"In William Goldings The Lord of the Flies, I can draw many parallels between the group of boys in the story and the basis for the television show “Sur- vivor”.In “Survivor”, contestants are forced to live together on a deserted island for a prolonged period of time. The rules are to form alliances and not to be deceived by the other players. This is similar to what happens in the novel The Lord of the Flies. A group of shipwrecked boys must form a soci- ety in order to have structure. Jack and Ralph are the two leaders with totally different ways of order. One wants to be a dictator and the other wants to be democratic.148  Another similarity between the novel and the show is that they place importance on objects. In the book, the conch is symbolic of power. On the show, if someone wins a race or something, they get a prize and the others don’t have anything! Also, both use ﬁre as a lifeline. In the show, when you are voted off the island, you must put out your torch. And both the show and novel have tribal meetings.I think the show “Survivor” and The Lord of the Flies tell about human nature and how societies are formed."

"Using a speciﬁc literary work, explain how a novel might inﬂuence change in society.",6,"Have you ever read a story that ultimately changed the way in which you thought about the world?So often we form our opinions and lifestyles from our families and what we observe around us. Could it be possible that a novel might change the way in people’s thinking? After reading Harper Lee’s To Kill A Mockingbird, I realized for the ﬁrst time how complex racism was, and the necessity for societal change.I have always been aware of cultural and racial differences in others. I was raised to accept people for their differences and judge people solely on their character. However, I wasn’t aware of the problems encountered by black people in the Deep South during the 1940s. In her novel, Lee makes it apparent that the color of skin was a determinant of social stature, no mat- ter your character.I felt that having a ﬁrst person narrator, told from the perspective of a young girl in the South was a brilliant way to tell this story. Scout is at the age where she is only beginning to understand how society handles diver- sity and cultural differences. A black man, Tom Robinson, is accused of rap- ing a white woman, even though none of the evidence points to him. For example, the narrator is a young girl named Scout. Her father, Atticus149  Finch, is a well-respected, highly moral lawyer who is defending Tom. Even though Atticus ﬁnds evidence contrary to the accusations, he has no hope of winning this trial. Scout ﬁghts a boy in her class who tells her that her father is defending a “(racial slur)”. Scout now begins to come to terms with her assumptions about people.An interesting point is made in this novel. While the white people of this small town in Alabama discuss the horrors of Hitler persecuting Jewish peo- ple, Scout wonders how the same people could not understand that the white people of her town were doing the same to the blacks. This sends a powerful message to the reader through such a vivid analogy.This novel elicits the reader to think about race relations and social big- otry. There are decent, moral black characters in this novel that are doomed because of their skin color. However, Lee portrays low class white families, such as Bob’s, undeserving of respect, but able to live on a much higher social stature than the blacks. When Tom Robinson is killed escaping from prison, the town barely takes notice.Through Lee’s novel, society is faced with the vulgarities of race and social class, along with the racism of this Southern town. Her message that neither race nor class, but actions, deﬁne someone’s character leave the reader with important social issues to be re-examined."
"Using a speciﬁc literary work, explain how a novel might inﬂuence change in society.",4,"In Harper Lee’s novel To Kill A Mockingbird, many racial issues are brought into the story for the reader to think about. I think Lee does a nice job of bringing these issues to light.Atticus Finch, a white lawyer, defending Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a white woman, sees that he has no chance of winning this case in this small Southern town, set in the 1940’s. Finch’s daughter, Scout, tells the story. I liked how Lee used Scout to tell the story, because it was from a child’s point of view. Scout must face prejudiced people in the novel who make fun of her father for taking this case, even though her father is respected.Many things in the novel make the reader feel horrible for the treatment of black people in this town. None of the evidence points to Tom, and even when he is shot at the end of the novel, no one seems to even care.I really believe because of this book, that many people’s ideas about race have been changed. I think that people should be treated with respect no matter the color of their skin.150  "

Cite a speciﬁc literary work and discuss the theme.,6,"Theme is the underlying message an author presents to his or her audience. Many times the theme of a work is apparent. Often we ask ourselves upon completing a novel, “What did that character learn at the end?” We base our judgment of characters on our cultural beliefs and emotions we expe- rience in our lives. In Herman Hesse’s Siddartha, the theme seems appar- ent—fulﬁllment in life through spiritual peace.The main character, Siddartha, takes the reader on his life’s journey to ﬁnd truth and meaning in life. He decides to leave home with his childhood friend, Govinda. The setting of this story is India, with the social caste system as the motivation for his journey. Siddartha realizes that he yearns for more knowl- edge and understanding; far more that his father can provide him with. He seeks spiritual fulﬁllment and wisdom. Even though this story is set in India, the theme is universal. Just as many of us decide to go on to college to learn more about the world, and ourselves; Siddartha does the same.At different stages of his journey he acquires wisdom, learns as much as he can, and forges on to new experiences. Siddartha is not unlike a person today in our culture. Many of us challenge ourselves with new ideas and experiences. Sometimes we fail, other times we succeed. However, what uni- ﬁes us is the desire to explore the unknown. The trade-off is we may discover we are much happier after taking those risks, than if we never ventured out. This is the theme in Siddartha. It is the message that is universal. In fact, there is a very popular book out now about moving cheese. It is a metaphor for the same theme as in Siddartha. Moving out of our comfort zones into a new, unfamiliar arena, hoping to ﬁnd what it is we are looking for.Siddartha goes through both pleasant and unpleasant experiences in this novel. At one point, he acquires incredible wealth and has every material possession he could ever dream of. However, at this point in his life, he con-151  templates suicide! He has become so gluttonous that he sickens himself. He realizes material possessions cannot bring him peace. From this scene, the theme of attaining spiritual peace is strengthened. How many times have we come across people with enormous wealth, but little peace and fulﬁllment in their lives?Siddartha is a great novel and its theme is apparent. The quest for spiri- tual peace, wisdom, and self-understanding is unpredictable, but attainable through the trials of life and what it has to offer."

"Compare/contrast the fear of terrorism and the concern with safety issues in present day society with George Orwell’s novel, 1984.",6,"The events of September 11th shattered our belief that we as Americans are immune to terrorism and its proponents. Our society has taken for granted security and free will. However, heightened measures have been taken in public arenas to bolster our safety. With this heightened security comes the forfeiture of some civil liberties that George Orwell wrote about in his novel 1984.In his novel, Orwell was writing from the perspective of nation that recently endured a world war. Orwell wrote his novel in 1948, and simply rotated the last two digits in the year to explore what the world might be like in the future. In this world that Orwell writes about, the government has surveillance in every imaginable public space. There is also a law enforcement collaborative called the “thought police.” In this society, no one could have anti-governmental sentiment whether vocalized or inter- nalized. If you violated this law, “Big Brother” took you away. This gov- ernment, (Big Brother), supposedly gave the citizens what they needed in order to survive. In this cold, mundane society, there was always a camera somewhere watching you. I think it is appropriate to assume that this soci- ety was under Communist rule, and Orwell was indeed frightening his read- ers to the thought of such a threat. This threat was very signiﬁcant in the times this novel was written. Orwell was conveying the themes of manipu- lation of the truth and loss of identity. In our present day society, there are many parallels to Orwell’s novel.Since September 11th, our government has taken steps in order to tighten security and minimize terrorist attacks. By the same token, members of our society must forfeit certain civil liberties. For example, if you travel by air now, you must arrive extremely early before departure, your belongings are scrutinized more closely, and you may have to be patted down or asked to remove your shoes. These actions seem to be intrusive, but most people will accept them to ensure safety.Furthermore, it is becoming commonplace to ﬁnd video cameras in many public arenas. Many airports, stores, and ofﬁces install cameras for surveillance. Technology has produced cameras that are so small, they can be installed in a shirt or jacket button. Many parents install cameras in their homes to monitor activity if they must leave and hire a sitter. Many police vehicles are equipped with video recorders so that the tape might yield evi- dence in court. There are even popular television shows that air actual sur- veillance tapes. This is eerily reminiscent of what occurs in Orwell’s 1984. Although we have no thought police, nor do we live under totalitarian153  rule, our society has deﬁnitely surrendered its privacy in order to protect its freedom. Orwell seemed to understand how technology can inﬂuence soci- ety and its freedoms."
"Compare/contrast the fear of terrorism and the concern with safety issues in present day society with George Orwell’s novel, 1984.",4,"George Orwell seems to understand how our society can become discon- nected from one another.I believe since the terrorist attacks, that our sense of security has been compromised. We now have surveillance in almost every aspect of life.In Orwell’s 1984, the society he writes about is very similar to what I have learned about Communism. In this society, there is a dictator and his ofﬁ- cials. No one in this society can think for themselves or think anything anti- government. If you do, then the “thought police” will come and get you. Also, there are cameras everywhere in the city. This is similar to what our society is going through now.Since the terror attacks, our government leaders have asked us to be on alert and to endure tighter restrictions while in public places. For example, you may have to take off your shoes in the airport now, since a terrorist was caught on a plane trying to light a fuse in his sneaker that contained explo- sives.Also, if you go to a store like 7-11 or Macy’s, you can always ﬁnd a cam- era looking at you. I personally feel frightened when I see a camera every- where, but it just might be helpful to catch people who break the law.I don’t believe that our society will become like Orwell’s society in 1984, but I do feel that camera surveillance and checkpoints are very similar to the plot in his novel."
"Compare/contrast the fear of terrorism and the concern with safety issues in present day society with George Orwell’s novel, 1984.",1,"In 1984, people have no privacy because the powers to be want to know what they think and how they act. This reminds me of what happens today. I went in to a store and tried to buy some snacks. A man behind the counter started to scream at me because he thought he saw me stealing something. Also, my dad ﬂies, and he says that is hard now because all the people check everything you have and they pat you down like in the movies. I don’tthink this is fair and it reminds me of Orwells story.154  "
"Personiﬁcation is the technique wherein a non-human character is given human thoughts, feelings, and dialogue. Illustrate how this technique is used in your favorite novel or short story.",6,"Personiﬁcation is a clever technique wherein non-human characters are given human characteristics. Using this technique, the reader is able to understand how an animal feels, or what a tree is thinking, or even the most intimate thoughts of an old pair of sneakers! Rudyard Kipling’s “Rikki- Tikki-Tavi” is one of my favorite short stories. In it, all of the animals are personiﬁed, which is crucial because the protagonist is a mongoose.Rikki-Tikki-Tavi is a small mongoose who nearly drowns after a ﬂood sweeps him away from his home. A boy named Teddy ﬁnds the mongoose, and he and his mother nurse the animal back to health. Rikki never con- verses in English with his human family, however he does interact with the other animals in the garden, speaking in English. I ﬁnd this technique to be helpful in formulating the plot. For example, a mongoose’s natural enemy is the cobra. Kipling uses these two enemies in the wild and makes them the protagonist and antagonist of the short story. Throughout the story, Rikki- Tikki ﬁnds himself battling adversaries in the garden in an effort to save Teddy’s family.This story follows the archetype of the battle between good and evil. If we look closely at the plot, biblical themes are apparent. Snakes in the gar- den may remind some of the biblical story of Adam and Eve. Without per- soniﬁcation in this biblical story, Eve might not have been tempted if the serpent didn’t have the ability to speak. Although Rikki-Tikki cannot con- verse with the humans in the story, the reader is able to understand his char- acter and his thoughts. For example, before he battles Nag, the male antagonist serpent, he is cautious and a bit nervous. However, he won’t show his fear to his enemy. Only the reader understands Rikki’s character from this point of view.Rudyard Kipling was clever enough to observe what occurs in nature, blending it with personiﬁcation, and creating a timeless story of good ver- sus evil."
"Personiﬁcation is the technique wherein a non-human character is given human thoughts, feelings, and dialogue. Illustrate how this technique is used in your favorite novel or short story.",4,"Personiﬁcation is the technique where the author gives non-human char- acters human thoughts, speech, and feelings. I like how this is used in Rud- yard Kipling’s Rikki-Tikki-Tavi.Without personiﬁcation, the main character, who is a mongoose, would not be able to express his feelings. The story would need a narrator, like the kind you see on television’s Wild Discovery. Some of those documentaries show animals in the wild, while a narrator tells the audience why the ani-155  mals behave certain ways. With personiﬁcation, a non-ﬁctional event can be ﬁctionalized.For example, a mongoose’s natural enemy in the wild is the cobra. In Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, the mongoose is the hero, while the cobra is the villain. Both animals have conversations with other animals and the reader can see what they are thinking about. Rikki-Tikki is nervous to ﬁght the cobras, but doesn’t show it when he starts to battle. I like how the author lets the story unfold through personiﬁcation.Although Rikki can’t talk with his human family, he behaves like a fam- ily pet. When the cobras plot to kill the family, Rikki defends them by killing the snakes. This story follows the common theme of good versus evil. Without personiﬁcation, the story would not be so enjoyable."

When I read this story I like how ani- mus can talk because then I can see how they feel and stuff.This is my essay on animuls and talking."
"Many times in Shakespeare’s plays, the setting changes from rural or pastoral to urban. Compare and contrast these settings. Explain the reason for the shift of scenery, using support from speciﬁc plays.",6,"Many times in Shakespeare’s works, the setting changes from a city to a pas- toral venue. Although change in setting is expected, there is an underlying reason why he chooses these speciﬁc areas. In his play A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the setting changes from the city of Athens to a forest near the city. The characters behave very differently in each setting.The play deals with marriages, love, family, and non-conformity. The Duke of Athens is about to be married to a woman who he recently defeated in war. Another element of the plot deals with a young woman whose father is demanding she marry a man she is not in love with. The woman decides to run away to the forest with the man she does love. There are two distinct settings here and I believe Shakespeare was mirroring human nature in the156  change of scenery. Often when someone is faced with a pressing problem or decision, they will retreat either physically to a quiet place to meditate, or they might go out with friends in order to take release from the issue or problem. Similarly in this play, the forest is viewed as a place of “non- reality,” or a dream world. Fairies and supernatural beings inhabit the for- est. This is a place of refuge that contrasts the conformity of the city. There are, however, similarities in both settings.Just as the Duke of Athens is marrying Hippolyta, there is King Oberon and his queen in the forest. Both couples are learning about the trials of love. There are colorful characters in both venues that keep the audience enter- tained also. One such character who lives in the forest is Puck. Puck is a fairy-type character who plays tricks on the characters and ultimately tries to teach them lessons throughout the play. One of the more famous lines from Shakespeare is found in this work when Puck states, “Oh what fools these mortals be.” There are lessons to be learned in both the city and the forest, but the forest is more of a dream world or an escape from reality.Shakespeare cleverly changes the setting in this play to expose human folly and lends keen insight into human nature."

Shakespeare does this to highlight human nature.In this play, there are two different worlds. One is the city of Athens where the Duke is about to be married. The city has its strict rules and con- formity. One part of the plot deals with a woman who doesn’t want to marry the man her father wants her to. She decides to run away to the forest with the man she loves. The forest is now seen as an escape from reality. In the forest, there are fairies and other supernatural beings. People also do this in real life. If someone is sad, they may go down to the beach to think or just to be alone.There is a similarity in both worlds though. There is the Duke of Athens in the city, and there is King Oberon in the forest. They both are involved with their marriages and try to help others with their problems.I think Shakespeare does a great job using the city and the forest in this play to show two sides of human nature."

"A third type of conﬂict is called character vs. him/herself. This is also referred to as internal conﬂict, because the character must face self-inﬂicted fears and problems. Write about this type of conﬂict, using a piece of literature that you have read.",6,"In many literary works there is a central conﬂict. Conﬂict can occur in many ways. There is character versus another character, character versus an out- side force like nature, and internal conﬂict, where a character must battle themselves mentally and emotionally. Often these types of conﬂicts can occur simultaneously in a literary work. I have chosen to discuss my favorite type of conﬂict in one of my favorite plays by Shakespeare; Hamlet.Internal conﬂict is the most intricate of all the types of conﬂict. We may read about a character that must physically defend themselves against another character. Also, there are many characters that have to brave the elements and survive in life-threatening situations. For example, Ishmael, the narrator and sole survivor in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick tells the story of the giant white whale. But the most intense is internal conﬂict. In Shake- speare’s Hamlet, a young prince must battle his conscience.Hamlet, the main character, has recently lost his father. While he is still mourning, his mother marries his father’s brother, Claudius. However, Hamlet’s father’s ghost appears to him and shows him the foul play that sur- rounded his death. Hamlet learns that his uncle actually murdered his father! This is where internal conﬂict is most present. In one of the most famous Shakespearian lines, Hamlet ponders, “To be, or not to be . . . ”. Hamlet must now decide whether to take action and avenge his father’s death, or to remain passive. This decision weighs so heavily on his conscience, that oth- ers notice a drastic change in his behavior. Hamlet must decide if being pas- sive is the equivalent of being a coward. Eventually, this play comes to a tragic end, and Hamlet decides to avenge his father’s murder.I believe that internal conﬂict works ideally in literature. Of course, Shakespeare presents Hamlet’s internal conﬂict through soliloquy, and this was performed on stage, but when you are able to read what a person is struggling through, you can more closely relate to the character. Internal158  conﬂict conjures up the fears that many of us have in everyday life. Hope- fully ours are not as tragic as Hamlets were!"

Write about this type of conﬂict, using a piece of literature that you have read.",4,"Conﬂict is what makes literature interesting to read. If there were no prob- lems, then the reader might become bored. One type of conﬂict is called internal conﬂict. This type occurs when a character is battling their con- science. One such character that experiences this is Hamlet from one of Shakespeare’s most famous plays.In Hamlet, the main character (by the same name), has just lost his father in a war. His father was the king of Denmark, and Hamlet is prince. Ham- let is visited by his father’s ghost and shown that his death was murder by Hamlet’s own uncle! This puts Hamlet in a really bad spot. Now he must decide whether to seek revenge for his father’s death or do nothing. Why would he do nothing? Well, his uncle is marrying his mother now. Hamlet has the toughest time trying to decide whether seek revenge. The famous quote “To be or not to be . . .” shows his internal conﬂict.Hamlet does seek revenge, but I like how Shakespeare shows what a character is thinking and what goes on in their minds. Internal conﬂict adds interest for audiences."

Write about this type of conﬂict, using a piece of literature that you have read.",1,"In this essay I will talk about what is internal conﬂict. In many works of writers, a person has thoughts that lead them to make choices. You can tell what that person is thinking by reading. Hamlet had one where he did not like his uncle and his dad was ded. Hamlet had to get even with his dads killers or do nothing. So Hamlet had a hard time trying to make up his mind.I think that internal conﬂict is when you have a problem that needs to have solved.159  "
Discuss a piece of literature in which the author is also the narrator. Describe the way he or she uses actual events from his or her life in his or her writing.,6,"In literature, there are varying points of view in relaying the events. If the narrator was actually part of the events, this is called ﬁrst-person narration. When the narrator is merely telling a story, but was not part of the events, this is third-person narration. At times, a reader might be thankful that the narrator is only telling a story as the events unfold, especially if the main characters are in some sort of danger. I personally enjoy ﬁrst-person nar- ration because you are allowed into the mind of the main character. This was especially enjoyable while reading J.D. Salinger’s Catcher in the Rye.The main character, Holden Cauﬁeld, is the narrator as well. He is a very complex character who doesn’t seem to ﬁt in socially. Salinger creates the world from Holden’s point of view. Although Holden seems apathetic towards many things in his life such as his schoolwork and friends, he is a deeply sensitive character marred by his view of the world. For example, in the beginning of the novel, Holden questions why his roommates are so pop- ular and can converse so well, especially with members of the opposite sex. His insecurities are revealed so that the reader can explore his character and perhaps identify with him. If Salinger had written this as a third-person nar- ration, the reader might not understand Holden’s character as well.Even though Holden Cauﬁeld is a tragic character, and many of his actions are not the most beneﬁcial, Salinger allows us to identify with Holden’s inse- curities and private dealings, many of which the reader might identify with."

"The coming of age theme is very popular in literature. This term refers to a pre-adolescent boy or girl going through many difﬁcult, life altering experiences in order to reach young adulthood. Using a novel you are familiar with, discuss this theme. Be sure to use supporting details and evidence in your essay.",6,"The theme “coming of age” is a common one, where an adolescent boy or girl is faced with decisions that ultimately lead them into adulthood. Barn Burning, by William Faulkner, embodies this theme with messages of fam- ily loyalty and morality.The story is set in the South, roughly thirty years after the Civil War. The main character who comes of age is Sarty Snopes, an adolescent whose father, Ab Snopes is a poor sharecropper frustrated by the post-Civil War Aristocracy. Sarty’s father is a very destructive, immoral character. In the South at this time, if a person wanted to deliver the most potent form of revenge against their neighbor, they would have someone burn their barn down. This crude assault makes perfect sense considering the main income providing lot was agriculture and livestock. If a person lost their barn where these things were stored, their lives would ultimately be ruined. Ab and his son drift from place to place, and Ab makes money as a hired “hit” for barns. His son is deeply troubled by his father’s destructiveness, but follows along out of “blood,” or the loyalty of family regardless of the activities.Throughout the novel, Sarty is faced with internal conﬂict. He knows that his father is doing something highly illegal and immoral; however, he wishes to remain loyal to family. Faulkner explores this coming of age theme with real depth and conviction, as the boy struggles with his conscience.The climax of this novel comes when the boy and his father are taken in by a warm, friendly man who provides the two with meals, lodging, and conversation. Sarty takes a genuine liking to the man; however, he knows that his father plans to burn the man’s barn down. Although he tries to con- vince his father not to commit this heinous act, Ab takes the boy in the mid- dle of the night towards the barn. Sarty makes the hardest decision of his life and warns the man. In the closing scene, a gunshot is heard and the161  reader can assume that the father has been caught and killed. Sarty has crossed the threshold of pre-adolescence and has deceived “blood” in order to preserve his morality.William Faulkner’s Barn Burning is a remarkable story of coming of age, where a boy must make the ultimate decision and thus becomes a man."

This is where a person would make all of their money, so it was the ultimate slap in the face if you wanted revenge on someone.

"Discuss how the reader might sympathize with the main character in Christopher Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus, even though he sells his soul to the Devil.",6,"The familiar adage about selling one’s soul to the devil conjures up two dis- tinct images—dabbling with the occult and being granted magical gifts.162  Although most people would not want to or would not dare to cross into such dangerous territory, Dr. John Faustus, the renowned scholar in this Elizabethan tragedy, could not resist.Christopher Marlowe, author of Dr. Faustus, created a complex charac- ter in the play of the same name. This character is tragic, foolish, ambitious, intelligent, and pitied. For all the good and bad traits he has, the audience cannot help but share in Faustus’ regret at the end of the play.Faustus has mastered many disciplines and is a well-known scholar. How- ever, he yearns for more knowledge beyond the realm of what is offered. Faustus summons the occult and encounters a demon named Mephistophe- les, a servant to Lucifer. Faustus makes an offer to give his soul to the devil in exchange for twenty-four years of magic. Mephistopheles tries to dis- suade Faustus from such a fate, but Faustus persists until the deal has been made. Once this occurs, Faustus is ready to satisfy his ambitions.At this point in the play, the audience—although apprehensive about Faustus’ choice—is just as curious as he was about magic and inﬁnite knowl- edge. Faustus wants to learn the secrets of the universe. He also wants a wife. Basically, he desires the things that most humans desire, and this is where Marlowe captures the audience’s empathy. We know that what Faus- tus has done is immoral and tragic, but we want to share in this display of power as he entertains courts by summoning historical spirits. The audience has pity for Faustus when he has bouts with his conscience. For example, at one point he prays desperately to God for forgiveness, but the audience realizes that no matter how desperate or how much he pleads, the devil will make sure the contract is honored. What is particularly powerful at the end of the play is the torment and desperation Faustus experiences as he ﬁghts the clock and tries to hold back time. But, the hours and minutes close in on his fate. Colleagues ﬁnd his body the next day, and the audience realizes that he has been dragged down to hell.Although the audience can blame Faustus for summoning the occult and bringing this tragedy on himself, Marlowe creates such a complex charac- ter that he is to be pitied for his choices."

He realizes he can’t get this knowledge from earth, so he sum- mons the help of the devil. The devil’s servant, Mephistopheles, tries to163  convince Faustus that this is something he should not play around with. Faustus is persistent, so the deal with the devil is ﬁnally sealed in blood.Faustus enjoys his newly found powers, such as bringing up spirits. He does however have bouts with his conscience about his choices. The audi- ence feels pity for him because we would want his power, but we deﬁnitely don’t want his fate. He tries to bargain and pray, but it is no use.

Discuss a hero in a literary piece that you have read.,6,"In her autobiographical novel, I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou relates her story as a poor black girl living in racially segregated Stamps, Arkansas. As the story unfolds, she describes relationships with her family and members of the community, her love of reading, her feeling of inequality, the racial prejudice she suffers, and her experiences as a single mother. What makes Angelou heroic, I think, is her perseverance over a multitude of odds.In the beginning of the novel, the reader learns that Angelou is living with her grandmother because her birth mother abandoned her. With no direction or positive inﬂuence in her life, a white woman introduced her to “her ﬁrst white love” – William Shakespeare –who befriended Angelou. Reading became an escape from her reality. In real life, she weathered many hardships on her path to adulthood. What then makes Angelou a hero?The archetype of a hero usually involves hardship, struggle, and an ardu- ous journey. When this hero reaches a certain breaking point or climactic scene, a turn of events usually brings about resolution, self-awareness, and peace. This is true in Angelou’s autobiography.164  Throughout the novel, racial prejudice is an overriding factor in her life. Even though Angelou documents her struggles against prejudice, lack of a formal education, and personal failure, she comes full circle when her son is born. She embarks on a new self-awareness and peace. There is a heroic quality about a woman who has overcome so many odds.Although Angelou is both author and subject, she embodies the spirit of a heroic character who ultimately prevailed against the odds."

Write a literary analysis of a Robert Frost poem. Include theme and symbolism in your discussion.,6,"Robert Frost’s comforting, sad, and often poignant poetry is usually ﬁlled with metaphors and vivid imagery. Perhaps my favorite Frost poem is “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.” The imagery creates a memo- rable portrait of the beauty and power of nature.165  Near the beginning, the narrator is introduced as a working man, who has stopped to rest: “My little horse must think it queer / To stop without a farmhouse near.” The narrator suggests that his days are mostly spent in labor, moving from place to place. On a whim, he stops riding to watch the “woods ﬁll up with snow.” During this brief moment, the narrator achieves spiritual transcendence and peace as he connects with nature.Throughout the poem, the narrator’s horse is a symbol of daily labor and the constant struggle of civilization. Taken from the wilds of nature, domes- ticated, and trained to obey orders, the horse no longer has any apprecia- tion of nature. While the narrator relaxes in the woods, his horse “gives his harness bells a shake / To ask if there is some mistake.” The irony here is that the man becomes even more connected to nature than the once-wild beast he rides.It’s important that this event takes place during “The darkest evening of the year” because the darkness allows the narrator to be hidden from the civilized and unnatural world he lives in every day. At the same time, the darkness of the evening is ironic because the narrator can’t really see the beauty of the woods very clearly. In this way, Frost suggests that nature’s beauty is more than just visual. It’s spiritual too. In the “lovely, dark and deep” woods, the narrator is able to fully appreciate the beauty of nature without seeing it.After his brief moment of peace, the narrator must return to the work- ing world. The line, “And miles to go before I sleep” is repeated at the end to show how weary and tired the narrator has become. Here, the “miles” represent long spans of time. He has a long time to wait before he gets home that night, and he also has a long time to wait before he reaches the ultimate sleep of death. But in this poem, the idea of death isn’t negative because when the narrator dies, he will ﬁnally be permanently reunited with the beauty of nature."
Write a literary analysis of a Robert Frost poem. Include theme and symbolism in your discussion.,4,"Robert Frost’s poem “Stopping By Woods On A Snowy Evening” can be interpreted as a man learning to appreciate nature.The poem starts out as a man in a horse-drawn carriage stops to appre- ciate the serenity of a dark, snowy evening. Although this might seem to be a simple poem using imagery, Frost sends a message about the power of nature. The man seems to enjoy the woods even more than his horse, who was probably born in the woods. It’s a dark evening but somehow the man can still appreciate the lovely forest.166  At the end of the poem, Frost says that he can’t stop to rest anymore because he has things to do. I thought this part was really sad because the man seemed so tired and didn’t want to leave.This poem has many symbolic elements in it and I enjoyed this very much."

Compare the society of The Scarlet Letter to our society today. Compare and contrast how Hester Prynne would have been treated today with how she was treated in the novel.,6,"Hester Prynne, from Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The Scarlet Letter, would not necessarily have fared much better today than in her own time. Some of the Puritanical inﬂuences in Salem, Massachusetts at that time still exist in modern society. Public ridicule remains an integral part of our culture, inﬁ- delity is still deplored, and unfortunately, women are still often seen as the more guilty party of any extramarital affair.In The Scarlet Letter, Reverend Dimmsdale is a spiritual leader of the community. However, he impregnates a young woman named Hester Prynne, who believes her husband has died at sea. As a result of their affair, Hester is forced to wear a scarlet “A” on her chest and stand in the midst of the town on a scaffold. Meanwhile, Dimmsdale keeps his distance and remains silent out of fear. In modern times, it would be hard to imagine anyone who has had an affair being forced to wear a red letter on his or her clothes for all to see, but, at the same time, public ridicule has become a part of modern culture as well. Celebrities are publically ridiculed on the cov- ers of tabloid magazines every day, and the details of their private lives are frequently broadcast on shows like Access Hollywood. In our society, extra- marital affairs have become public knowledge. From celebrities to politi- cians, one way or another, affairs make news and sell papers.167  Also, in the book, Hester Prynne is unfairly singled out as the guilty one as a result of Dimmesdale’s silence. Even now, it is often the woman who is viewed as the immoral one with poor judgment. Although Dimmesdale ﬁnally delivers a powerful sermon toward the end of the novel, confessing to the affair before his congregation, he dies—rather conveniently—shortly after, thereby escaping any punishment or public ridicule. So, in the end, Hester Prynne may not have been treated much better in our times. For its portrayal of this timeless situation, The Scarlet Letter remains a viable novel."
Compare the society of The Scarlet Letter to our society today. Compare and contrast how Hester Prynne would have been treated today with how she was treated in the novel.,4,"Our society views women the same as in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s Scarlet Let- ter. It’s very interesting how things change very little in such a wide span of time. Hester Prynne is brought in front of the town on a scaffold for having an affair and becoming pregnant. Her husband is assumed lost at sea, however the townspeople scorn her and exclude her from society. She is made to wear a letter A on her clothes for embarrassment. Although sometimes women who have affairs are treated badly, they don’t ever have to wear scarlet letters any- more.Reverend Dimmsdale is never really looked at badly, even though at the end he confesses. It’s the same today. Usually, there is one person who is viewed as the bad guy, and one person who is innocent, even though both people are having the affair. It’s the same sort of thing you read in the news- papers with celebrities and politicians, it seems someone is always having an affair. For all these reasons, I think that what happens in the book is mostly the same as what would happen in modern times."
Compare the society of The Scarlet Letter to our society today. Compare and contrast how Hester Prynne would have been treated today with how she was treated in the novel.,1,Hester in the scarlet letter was a women who had had an afair with an importent man and she was made fun because of it. She had to where an A letter to show she was sorry. Everyne in the town didnt like her becase they think she did something very bad and they also were not mean to the man. I wouldnt treet poeple like that along time ago today or in the futur either.
