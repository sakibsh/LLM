But the two had never been very close. That is, until Jesse shows up on his doorstep...",English,918,1/?,,,,0,"Chapter Text


They’d just fired him.


How could this be? What kind of injustice is this?


At first, Jesse Marsch had been angry. He’d blamed the U.S. government, the Premier League, the wind, coffee, referees—you name it, he blamed it. But after a full fifteen minutes of ranting to his wall, Marsch’s fury vanished, leaving behind a giant Leeds-shaped hole in his heart.


He’d thought Leeds would keep him forever. And now it was all gone, stolen from him by some money-loving—


Jesse Marsch! He scolded himself, slapping his own thigh. He was sure the heavy slam had left a bruise, but he didn’t care. He needed to get out of this house, away from this city, somewhere. But where?

Judging by how the news had just come out, news of his sacking was probably on Monday Night Football. That meant wherever Marsch would try to go, somebody would recognize him. That bars out the pub.

He couldn’t breathe anymore. Everything around him served as a symbol of what he’d lost, the life he’d lived for little over a year. He threw together some things in an overnight bag and jumped into his car.

*

Klopp blankly stared out the window of his room. Not his room in Kirkby, which had truthfully become more of a home to him, but the house he’d rented from Rodgers.

He wouldn’t admit this to anybody, but Klopp had completely run out of ideas as to why Liverpool were doing so horribly. So after the Wolves game, Klopp went straight back to his house. He needed to step away from his job, even for half an hour.

As soon as he’d shut the door, though, Klopp had a new problem. The house lacked the sounds of daily life.

There was no sound of Nemmer or Thiago dropping a baking sheet or pot. No sound of Robertson and Alexander-Arnold chattering away, or Tsimikas remixing his rap songs, or Adrian’s snoring. There was no la-la-la from Van Dijk singing in the shower, no boom from Alisson’s ball cannon, not even a hiss from the coffee maker.

It was too quiet…until car tires screeched through the night. Then a car door slammed, and a trunk opened, and something wheeled across the driveway.

Then the doorbell rang.

Klopp jumped from his seat to answer, thinking it was one of the boys or even Lijnders. What he didn’t expect was a groveling American in blue jeans and a gray sweater.

“Take me in, please!!!”

Jesse Marsch was at his doorstep.

Jesse flipping Marsch.

*

“Jesse Marsch!” Klopp exclaimed. “How the hell did you find my house?!”

Marsch didn’t get off the ground. He clung to Klopp, temporarily immobilizing the German. “I don’t know how I got here! I just did!”

Klopp couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “So you arrived at my house without even knowing my address?”

“I was fired,” Marsch moaned, finally removing himself from the ground. “So I came to your place. You’re the only one who let me in—everybody else turned me away.”

“Who did you go to?” If it was one of his boys who’d turned Marsch away and made him this hysterical, then Klopp had a serious talk to give out.

Marsch shrugged, calmer than he’d been at first. “Well…Erik’s, Antonio’s, Ole’s and Gary’s.”

“You do realize that three of those four are Man. U affiliated and the fourth isn’t even in the country, right?”

Klopp could spot Marsch’s flushed face from a mile away. “I guess you’re right. But as long as you’re up…I brought Budweiser.”

“Come in.” Klopp shook his head, opening the door. “You’re lucky I’m not Jose or you wouldn’t have lasted two minutes.”

*

Marsch sat at the counter, watching Klopp grated cheese over a frozen pizza. For a while neither one of them said anything, to each other or to themselves. The only sound was the Parmesan rubbing against the grater and the oven warming up. Once the oven timer signaled that it was ready for the pizza, the talking began.

“So they sacked you,” Klopp began, pouring potato chips into a serving bowl. “I think that sucks.”

He regretted the word choice almost before the words left his mouth. But it seemed like the best way to put it.

“I just don’t get it. I mean, I did the best I could!” Marsch lamented. He didn’t even seem interested in the potato chips. “I saved Leeds from relegation on the final day, and I fell in love with them. Haven’t you ever been sacked?”

“I stepped down from Mainz and Dortmund. But I never got sacked.”

“Well, imagine if they ripped you away from your boys,” Marsch said, slowly nibbling on a chip. “And you left in disgrace from the people who once chanted your name.”

Klopp nodded in understanding. “I hate the thought of that. Couldn’t they give you something? More time, understanding, remembering what you’d done for them before? You were only there for one year.”

Marsch shook his head. “Leeds owners aren’t that understanding. I wish I had your owners.”

“Trust me, you were better off. I speak from experience. At least Man. City's owners allow them to buy players.”

“Their owners got hit with more than 100 charges against Fair Play rules.”

“Fair.” Klopp reached into the bowl only to hit the bottom of it. “More chips?”

Marsch flashed him a lopsided thumbs-up. “Only advantage about this is that we get to eat as many chips as we want.”"

Last thing he knew, Sidney dropped a TV on his head and he was also bleeding out but currently, nothing hurts. He shifts around, determines he is actually in a coffin (the fuck?), and considers what to do.

Well, obviously, nothing can be done until he's out of the coffin, so he gets to work.

.

As he breathes the cool night air, Stu looks at the placemarker where a headstone should be. That tells him a little about how long it's been. Since he clearly won’t be able to get away with being an innocent survivor (he was fucking buried), Stu fixes the gravesite back to looking freshly-laid and not like someone just crawled out of it.

First things first, a change of clothes and some food. Then, finding out what the fuck happened.

.

What happened was that Sidney fucking Prescott somehow managed to kill both Stu and Billy, and not only that, but Gale Weathers, Tatum’s idiot brother, and fucking Randy Meeks all survived.

Billy died but Randy is still alive, and Stu seethes.

.

Billy died.

That’s… not an outcome Stu ever imagined. He figured there’s a good chance he himself wouldn’t make it, but Billy—

Billy doesn’t even have a grave. They cremated him. Makeshift memorials have gone up all over Woodsboro for everyone, all the way back to Sid’s mom, but Billy gets nothing.

Four days out of the grave, and Stu has never been so furious..

In a diner in Oregon, with a plateful of breakfast hash and a notebook full of half-baked ideas, Stu shivers as a tingle dances along his spine.

A pale guy slides into the booth across from him, messy dark hair that reminds him of Billy and a smirk that’s all teeth. Stu blinks at him but the guy just reaches out to steal his breakfast.

“Go on,” he says, adding salt and pepper to the hash, with a nod to the notebook. “I’m curious to see what you come up with.”

“Who the fuck are you?” Stu demands quietly because even though he’s supposed to be dead, everyone is still freaked out by the so-called Woodsboro Massacre. (Okay, the name is kinda cool. It still feels like failure because Billy—)

“Call me Ben,” he says, and now he’s reaching for Stu’s soda.

Stu just lets him take it. “Okay, Ben,” he hisses, pulling the notebook closer. “And what the fuck do you want?”

Ben’s pale eyes assess him as Ben leans back, still fucking smirking around Stu’s breakfast. “You need a teacher, kiddo,” he says, like he’s not barely older than Stu, from what Stu can tell. Stu’s normally good with accents but he can’t place Ben’s, just some bland Midwestern type thing.

“A teacher?” he echoes, because what?

“A mentor, an instructor, a trainer, take your pick,” Ben says before taking a gulp of the soda. “I’ve grown bored with my current circumstances, moralizing boyscouts always preaching at me, you know,” he continues though Stu, of course, does not know, “and you seem to be quite entertaining.”

Stu stares at him. He straightens up, pushes the plate and cup to the side, clasps his hands on the table. Seriously, quietly, he says, “You remind me of my brothers,” and he looks Stu straight in the eyes. “Without being tempered, you will attract attention and too much attention, Stuart, is fatal for our kind.” Ben grabs the knife from the tableware still wrapped in a napkin, scoffs at it, and as Stu watches in bewilderment, he slices open the pointer finger of his right hand.

And then, lightning dances across the finger, leaving unscored skin in its wake.

“What the fuck,” Stu murmurs. Ben just smirks at him again. Still. Stu wonders, inanely, if the bastard can even make another expression.  “Just… what the fuck.”

“Are you finished with breakfast?” Ben asks, pulling out his wallet. “I’m quite curious about the plans you’ve got in there.” He tilts his head toward Stu’s notebook, which Stu quickly flips closed.

Stu now leans back, crosses his arms over his chest. Then, he shrugs, says, “Ah, what the fuck,” and when Ben throws down a 20, he follows the guy out into the bright morning."

He frequented all of the local bakeries and candy shops in town on a regular basis so surprising him with holiday treats was next to impossible. He loved it when you went on dates with him to share sandwiches and creamy milkshakes, but you weren’t convinced it was special enough.Inspiration struck you one day when you were helping Arcturus in the academy kitchen. He was making a cheese sauce to accompany one of the side dishes at dinner. You were whisking the sauce to keep it from burning to the bottom of the pot.“Hey, Arcturus?”He hummed in acknowledgement while he was bent low, pulling a hot pan from the oven.“Have you ever had fondue?”Arcturus placed the tray on a cooling rack and took off his oven mitts. “Hm, I’m not sure that sounds familiar.”You explained to him it was like a presentation of a warm cheese used for dipping bread, potato, or certain types of fruit.“Oh, that sounds delicious!” Arcturus beamed at you. “I bet Pollux would love that too.”You experimented in the kitchen when you had free time. You decided to try making a chocolate fondue dip, experimenting with the ratios of cream, chocolate, and vanilla before adding a touch of sweet brandy.When you perfected your recipe, you walked into town to gather the missing items for Pollux’s gift. You couldn’t find a fondue pot, but you were able to find a small serving dish you could keep warm with a small lantern. You visited the bakery and grocer, picking up cookies and fresh fruits to slice and use for dipping. You gave Pollux a handwritten invitation to join you in your room later that evening. He blushed when he took the envelope from you, reading the card with a pleased twinkle in his eyes. “Are we having a tea party?” he asked excitedly. Tea parties always involved some sort of dessert.“Something like that.” You smiled at him and kept your response vague. You wanted to give him something to look forward to.Your plan went off without a hitch. Pollux arrived at your door right on time, wearing an elegant suit you’ve never seen before. He blushed and handed you a small bouquet of beautiful flowers. “These only bloom during the coldest months of the year,” he explained while you found a small vase to put them in. The blue and purple flowers almost looked like they were covered in fresh, powder-white snow. You wrapped your arms around him and pulled him close. “They’re beautiful, thank you.” The flush on his face deepened even more when you stood on your toes and kissed his cheek.He followed you to the little table you set up near the balcony doors, the dip already prepared and warming over a gentle flame. Pollux leaned over and looked into the pot.“Chocolate?”You used a small fork to pierce a slice of strawberry. “It’s a dish from back home,” you explained as you dipped the strawberry into the pot. “It’s a warm dip called fondue. It’s popular to make with cheese.” You leaned forward, cupping your hand under the fork and holding it in front of his mouth. “I thought you might enjoy trying the dessert version instead.”He held your gaze, eyes glittering while he wrapped his lips around the fruit and slid it off the fork. There was a small smudge of chocolate in the corner of his mouth. He wrapped his hand around your wrist before you could pull away. He put the fork back into his mouth, letting it slide between his lips while he chased the lingering hints of chocolate left behind. He grinned while he licked his lips.You set the fork back down on the table, and you looked at each other for a moment. Pollux turned away first, drawing a chair from under the table and taking a seat. He slowly unbuttoned his dinner jacket and loosened the tie around his neck. He had a teasing smile but the glint in his eye was no less hungry. He leaned back in his chair and patted his lap invitingly. You could already see the outline of his bulge straining against the zipper of his pants.“I’m starving.”"

Kennedy', 'salazar castle', 'Game: Resident Evil 4 (2005)', 'takes place in chapter 3-2', 'Sun and Moon Symbolism', 'Internal Monologue']",No,"Ada sits perched atop a windowsill in the Salazar Castle and looks up at the moon, and down at her version of the sun.",English,826,1/1,,,,0,"Ada: Salazar Castle: Bedroom:

 
I sat perched atop a windowsill, looking out at the green maze below. The bushes rustled in the cool wind, and the stars shone from above, peeking behind the clouds. The moon was nestled in between them comfortably, overlooking all, just like me. I thought me and the moon might get along quite well, always staring in the night, and disappearing by the time dawn breaks. And to my amusement, it turned out that the sun himself was down in that maze, shooting his gun at parasitic creatures. I smiled to myself, watching him dart around the garden in search of the two halves of the crescent moon that would grant him access to the bedroom– it seemed as if the sun was always in search of the moon, no matter the circumstances. I couldn’t be bothered by the tacky puzzle, so I just used my grappling hook to slide through an open window. The same window I’m sitting on right now, dancing on a fine line between plummeting down to the horrors below, and the safety of the red-plush carpet. 

Leon, the bright beam of sunshine, held the other half of the crest in his hand, fitting it together to see if they would click. In his hands now, he held the entire stone object. Too big to fit in his pockets, he held it in the crook of his arm and made his way around the maze, making his way to me. I smiled softly, tilting my head and seeing his oh-so determined expression. Seven years he hasn’t seen me, for seven years he’s thought of me as dead. I guess in some way that was true, when have I ever been alive? Through the thrill of a mission, maybe. But as a person? Who lives, and breathes normally? Who can get by without working for shady organizations and betraying them? No, I don’t think so. I’m like the phantoms that are surely stalking the halls of this castle, maybe even watching me right now. 

I suppose the only times I feel alive are when I’m around him. There’s always an exciting feeling that pulls on the deepest strings of my heart, exhilaration, excitement, and sometimes also sorrow. The sorrow of knowing that because of the roles we’ve decided to take in society, we could never wake up beside each other every day. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t thinking about him every moment I had to myself, now I’d see him again, be able to hear him talking directly to me, be able to study the bags under his eyes, and the new length of his hair. I’m sure he’ll do the same for me, look at the black flutter of my eyelashes and make his way down to the shiny red fabrics of my dress, then finally to my strappy heels. Not like I won’t play my game though, he’ll have to catch me first. Can’t forget I also have a task at hand, to collect the sample. 

These creatures have shaped out to be quite a pain, however. The village chief was gone, courtesy of Leon, so he won’t be getting in the way anymore. Can’t say for that bratty Salazar, or Saddler. I’m sure they’ll be gone in due time, however. We always have these ways of working things out. It’s funny, of all the things we can do alone, we always fall apart when we’re together. Life works in such mysterious ways, it fascinates me. Always on the run, always watching and waiting but never settling. Me and the moon, Leon and the sunshine. The sun and the moon, always running to catch one another, always worlds away. 

Of all the people I’ve tricked and conned, I couldn’t find the courage in myself to do it to Leon. Sure, I’ll play games with him, smile, walk away and eventually vanish, but when it comes to it, I won’t lie to him. The truth is valuable, and it can save lives. Maybe even sometimes destroy them, believe me, I’ve learned that the hard way– but not when it comes to Leon. I’ll help him with his mission, and in the end, he’ll help me with mine. Everything always comes full circle. 

Even in terms of the moon. 

Even when covered partially by clouds, the spherical shape always resides behind the darkness, hiding, 

Always with the sun, 

It’ll always burn brightly. 

Breathing in the crisp night air, I hopped down from the window and walked slowly behind the door, red painted nails shining against the shiny silver of my gun. I could feel it this time, the pounding in my heart, the anticipation. There was a click at the door, the crest was being set into place. 

Pushing up my sunglasses, a smile played across my glossed lips. 

It was time to say hello. 

It was time to bask in the light of the sun."

They’re not even far from the group, but Foolish had to say it, he clutches the poppy close to his chest. The delicate flower that he hadn’t let go of since he got it. The red is just as vibrant as he hands it back to the shorter. Hands barely grazed one another and yet it felt like too much- perfect- not enough. Mariana brought a hand up to stroke the petals, they hadn’t begun to wilt despite how long they remained without water. Still, Mariana brought it close to his chest as Foolish had done moments ago. It was almost enough to stop the confusion and sadness. 
 
There was so much they could tell each other. Maybe in another life, this moment was where they talked and realized they could love. That this new environment was a fresh start where they could learn. Be together with nothing holding them back. Grow a garden of flowers. Instead, Mariana continued to clutch the singular flower and look up at Foolish with a small hesitant kind of smile. “When- When you are ready. I will be here.” 
 
“Right.” Foolish grinned but it lacked teeth, something more intimately dejected. He paused, debating his next move before taking a step closer and bringing the other into a hug. Mariana held the flower between them but used his one free arm to return the hug. Head resting on the other chest he could hear the thundering heartbeat and it strangely… gave him comfort. The other wasn’t content either, but Mariana wasn’t going to push or pressure, not with the wound so freshly cut. 
 
They pulled away, and he.. well, Mariana couldn’t find what to say. Not in english. “mi amor no se empañara como el oro de tu piel” and he means it. Foolish nods even though he doesn’t understand, and his smile grows wider. 
 
Then the shark takes a step back, then another. Mariana waves, and they both turn away. 
 
There was so much more to them than they could currently remember. Foolish and Mariana an unlikely duo. A god and a man, ageless and young, they barely speak one anothers language. Yet they seem inexplicably intertwined; the passion of love transcends. It will return; they’re far too enchanted."

A pretty, but stone-faced girl with short black hair and freckles walked in. She had a giant black bag slung over her shoulder, but either it was empty or she was strong enough not to notice the weight. The clicking of her footsteps echoed around the silent room, the only other sound being quiet gasps of confusion from some of my classmates. I glanced over at the still-open door. A figure lurked there in a black suit. Red eyes glowed between long, dark locks that obscured most of his face and flowed to the floor.

The girl reached the teacher's desk. For a moment, there was complete silence. She dropped the bag on the desk.

Soshun didn't waste a second. He stepped forward, his voice swelling into Student Council President Mode™. ""You! Talk! I don't know where you get off threatening us, but it's not going to work!""

Kiriko's voice wavered for a moment as she piped up. ""Th-that video...was it real?""

The girl remained silent.

""Why'd we have to hold this dumb meeting so late?"" Aiko pouted, resting her chin on her fists.

""This is not at all how we operate."" Hino added, and Kubo nodded furiously.

The girl finally spoke, her voice softer than I expected. ""Student Council members. In accordance with my sister's will, you will now murder each other.""

My eyebrows shot up. Murder?!

A chair scraped against the floor. ""Are you crazy?!"" Ikuta burst out, slapping her hands on the desk in front of her. ""Why the hell would we do something like that?!""

Soshun turned to her and flung out his hand. ""That's enough! It's essential that we all remain calm!"" If the situation wasn't so serious, I would've snorted. He knew, probably better than anyone, that trying to calm Ikuta was fruitless. ""Should we succumb to--""

""Hold it."" The voice was low and quiet, but somehow stunned even Soshun into silence. Everyone's heads turned in near-unison. The girl was pointing a gun at Ikuta. I could tell from her stance she knew what she was doing with it. Her line of sight was clear, and her thumb rested on the safety.

The long-haired boy entered the room, but she held the gun steady. He continued, ""I have changed my mind.""

The girl's eyes widened, and she whipped her head around to look at the boy, gun still trained perfectly on Ikuta. ""Wh-what?! Don't you want to see true Despair?""

The boy snorted and closed his eyes. ""Killing...is not true Despair. Killing, Death...are not interesting. They're...predictable. You kill her, they kill each other. Maybe you. But that small variation alone is not enough to be...unique.""

There was a blur of motion, and suddenly the gun was in his hand,  pointed at the girl. ""If this is truly the best Despair has to offer me...then I'll be on my way."" The gun clattered to the floor, and he turned to leave.

""Wait! But Junko--""

""Junko is also...not unique. Besides, this was not what she predicted from me. Wouldn't that...give her that Despair she loves so much?"" He dragged out the word ""Despair"" with as much venom as his completely deadpan voice could muster. ""Tell your sister to come back when she comes up with something actually exciting."" He left the room, the girl running after him.

Nobody spoke. Ikuta slowly sat back down. Soshun approached the desk and pulled open the bag. ""This is...an obscene amount of weapons!"" he said, mostly to himself. He turned back to face us. ""I'm going to confiscate these and take them to our headmaster. I think it would be best if we all departed before she returns.""

Several nods of agreement, and we dispersed back to our rooms. Ikuta didn't say a word, just nodded to everyone and left. I wasn't exactly surprised, though; that mouth of hers nearly got her killed.

I went back to my room and lay on the bed, staring at the ceiling. Would we...have really done it? Could any of us have...actually killed each other? No, definitely not. That would be ridiculous.

I rolled over and fell asleep."

Yujin couldn't help it.
It wasn't his fault.
It just happened that way.He was watching just like everyone else. Watching as each trainee walked out with a wig and light makeup.And then there was Gunwook.Why Gunwook? What drew him to Gunwook? Nothing had. At least, not before... but now...Gunwook looked so pretty, he should dye his hair a light orange. His sharp features had a new edge in this light. In the pastels.They'd never even spoke - not really, there wasn't a chance.
And Yujin was anxious.Han Yujin was always anxious.
Gunwook made him anxious before because he was so driven, right? He was so determined, so praised...
Yujin was...""Yujin-ah, you okay?""
Jiwoong. Always looking out for him.
Yujin stared at his hands by the sink, looking up at himself through the reflection of the mirror.Never before had he considered boys. There just wasn't a chance.Wasn't a Gunwook.""Yeah, Hyung, just finishing up.""Yujin exited the bathroom, wiping his hands on his pants.Jiwoong rubs Yujin's hair as he walks past.""You've been so quiet lately,"" he says, ""you okay?""How does Yujin tell Jiwoong about this? Jiwoong acts in BLs, he wouldn't be rude about it.But Yujin doesn't even know how he feels.Maybe, maybe it's not Gunwook, maybe it's just girl-Gunwook.Voices trail down the hall, and Yujin stiffens, on edge.It's just Keita and Junhyeon.Yujin ignores how Jiwoong watches Keita.""I'm fine, just stressed about the next stage.""Jiwoong tears his gaze back to Yujin, you'll be great. I know it. Don't worry about anything, the masters are too harsh on you.""""Yeah... thanks.""
He feels horrible.***Yujin's dorm is empty that night. He's reading, the only occupied bed in the room. He doesn't know where the others are, and he doesn't want to deal with the chance encounter of Gunwook.Someone knocks on the door.""Come in!"" He calls.Gunwook pokes his head around the corner, and Yujin's heart sinks to his stomach.
The one person he was trying to avoid.Gunwook clearly doesn't know, or care. Completely oblivious to Yujin's feelings that just barely bubble bellow the surface.In the creeping edges of his mind, he sees another life. One where they meet for coffee at the store by Yujin's house, their hands swaying as they walk together in the park, cuddling up close in the cinema.His eyes burn at the life that never was.""Hey... Yujin-ah.""Everyone's informal because he's the baby. Of course.""Have you seen Sung Hanbin-hyung?Oh.""Uh, no, sorry.""Gunwook nods, lingering.Stay.""Alright, sorry to interrupt"" He looks at Yujin's hands, ""-your book.""Yujin looks down, completely oblivious to the fact he'd even been reading before.""Oh, no, it's okay, I'm barely reading it anyway.""Gunwook laughs. It's so, right. Like, what you want to hear. The laugh of someone who genuienly finds you funny.He wants to always make Gunwook laugh.""I can relate to that.""It's still for a moment. Yujin's hoping the cameras won't broadcast this to the world.It's their moment. The fresh encounter of two teenagers just finding their footing in the world.Please, let me have just this much.Gunwook sighs - not of annoyance - right? No, more like, I'll get going now, right?""I'll see you later, yeah?""Yujin nods, ""Yeah... later.""And Gunwook disappears out of sight, shutting the door quietly behind him.Shit."

But he also enjoys something sweet and jazzy every now and then☆ I don't know why but for me the song “Love Shack” by B-52's literally screams Vash vibes☆ Also: Vash just loves parades and anything where people can dress up, so whenever there's an event like that, he will be there☆ He loves to dress up himself, but the thing that makes Vash most excited and fills his heart with utter joy is seeing everyone else being happy and celebrating, especially little children having fun and enjoying themselves.

There was a celebration planned at his family’s ancestral home, and he was eager to show you Bound Arlyn’s finest holiday traditions.You waved when you saw him step into view nearby. His long blonde hair was tied in a braid so it didn’t tangle in his scarf. He wore a long coat of emerald green with fur trim. He looked particularly handsome today with snowflakes dusting his fine hair and pale skin.“I’m sorry for the delay, there was a mix-up with our tickets. Shall we?” He slipped the handle for your luggage out of your grip and pulled it for you beside his own. You fell into step with his long stride as he moved aside so you could board ahead of him.You glanced back over your shoulder as you stepped inside the carriage. “Wait, what about the others? Aren’t they coming too?” The other Guide sorcerers were usually on the guest list for Spica’s parties.He hesitated for a moment, looking away. “I’m afraid they’re busy with other engagements this evening.”You shrugged and followed him to your seats.The festivities were starting to wind down and you watched Spica with amusement as he finished another glass of wine. You didn’t drink often, and you barely finished your own glass despite sipping it throughout dinner and the dessert that followed. His cheeks were ruddy-pink and his eyes a bit glossy in the warm candlelight of the dining hall. You caught his gaze across the table and he flashed you a wide smile. He came over to you, sliding your chair out from the table and offering his arm before leading you away. He walked you to his private chambers in a quiet wing of the large estate. You had an arm wrapped around his waist to help support his uneven gait. He held you to his side with an arm slung across your shoulders. When you slipped through his bedroom door, you walked him over to the bed. He sat down and you unbuttoned his shirt while he slid off his shoes. He loosened his tie earlier in the evening so you slid it from around his collar and set it aside. His shirt fell into an undignified heap on the floor. He slumped over and got comfy against the pillows with his undershirt and dress pants still on.It only took a minute for you to slip off your dress and pull a nightgown over your head. When you lifted the blankets and slid into bed beside him, Spica rolled over to face you. You cuddled into his chest and he wrapped an arm around you with a deep, happy sigh. Yo could smell the sweet alcohol lingering on his breath.“It’s a shame the others couldn’t make it tonight,” you said quietly, head resting under his chin. “Pollux would’ve loved the desserts.”“Didn’t invite ‘em,” Spica mumbled into your forehead with a yawn. “Wanted it to just be the two of us.” When you pulled back in surprise, he was already fast asleep.A gentle hand was stroking your hair when you woke up. You blinked the sleep from your eyes and raised your head from where you were sleeping on his chest. His eyes were clear this morning, the tipsy haze gone, and they were so tender and full of love.“Good morning,” he murmured as he continued to brush his fingers through your hair.“Good morning,” you said with a sleepy smile. He smiled back when you covered a yawn with your hand. “What time is it?”He glanced towards the large windows of his room. They were frosted over with cold. “Still early, I believe. Just before dawn.”You pressed closer into his side and burrowed into the warm sheets. “How do you feel?” You didn’t want to ask him directly if he was hung over, but he guessed your meaning when you tried to suppress a giggle.“A slight headache, but nothing unbearable,” he sighed. “Did you enjoy the party?”You recalled the festive decorations, the delicious food, and the other party guests that greeted you with kindness. “I loved it. I can almost see why you didn’t want to invite anyone else.”Spica froze beside you and he seemed to be struggling for words. “We don’t get time alone as much as I would like,” he admitted, “and I wanted our first Christmas together to be special.” He frowned. “I didn’t want to babysit those troublemakers. Besides, it’s not proper to drink with children in attendance.”You sat up and laughed as you pressed a kiss against his cheek. “I always trust your judgment and last night was perfect.” You nuzzled your nose with his. “Thank you.”One of his hands cradled the back of your head and drew your lips down into a kiss. It was slow and gentle but no less passionate. You moaned softly and eventually you drew back to catch your breath.He held you close and rolled over gently so you were underneath him. He ran his hands up your thighs and under your nightgown as he kissed you again, gliding his tongue against your own. During the night he must’ve slipped off his dress slacks because you felt his cock harden inside the silky material of his boxer shorts. You wrapped a leg around his, grinding up against him encouragingly. He pulled down the waistband of his boxers and you gasped when you felt him slide inside you with one long, slow thrust.You moved together under the sheets as the sun shone down on you through frosted glass."

Kat’s first actual impression on Molly was that she murdered Andrea. Well, there was the whole pronouncing Andrea’s name thing, but she can’t blame the new kid for that. But what’s jarring, is that on the same day, Molly is found at the stage carrying Andrea’s unmoving body. Thankfully, Andrea woke up and explained everything before anyone could get any ideas. After that, Kat was sure that she won’t see Molly again. Until she randomly took a picture of her and showed up at the Wilderscouts camping trip. She saw that list Molly was carrying around during the whole trip, was the new kid; grading them? For what? And right before everyone goes home, Kat saw Libby giving Molly a friendship bracelet. Sure, that wasn’t weird, the former outcast trying to make friends with the new kid. It makes sense why Libby would prefer Molly over her and Sheela. But what didn’t make sense to her is how Molly reacted. It’s nice to make new friends, but to get so excited over it to the point where you tackle them with a hug? Who does that? She thought about it a lot on the ride home and… Did Molly even have friends before moving to Brighton?"

Seungmin's not really used to the one-on-one proximity with his boyfriend in front of the cameras. Whenever they’re shown together, it’s under the guise of their “Divorced” status and their interactions are always painted as awkward. 
 

It angers Seungmin, 

just 

a bit. 
 

Okay. Maybe a lot. 
 

Seungmin and Minho are the furthest thing from awkward. They're probably among the closest within the group, actually. The fact that they’re right here, in a cramped ass room to get clues so they can escape, the 

day after

 they’ve made it official and are acting completely normal is testament to how comfortable they are with each other. 
 

They're on the same wavelength on just about everything. They're both calm and collected despite half their members screaming up a storm in the adjacent rooms. They both get suspicious about the same things. 
 

They both find themselves constantly sharing glances and averting each other's eyes throughout filming, having to suppress the shy smiles that threaten to break. The editors would have their work cut out for them, going through the footage and clipping out their incessant sickeningly longing gazes. He wonders how they’ll spin their silence as awkward again. 
 

And maybe Seungmin feels his heart pick up and zoom within the confines of his ribcage when they lean a bit close and Minho’s warmth envelops him whole. 
 

Maybe his heart literally jumps into his throat when their thumbs brush. Maybe he feels his brain melt into goo when he films Minho mercilessly ripping into the stuffed puppy with the widest smile on his face and childlike joy. He does call Minho a psychopath when his boyfriend literally 

giggles, 

but 

hey, 

Minho’s 

his 

psychopath, alright?
 

Maybe he wants to kiss Minho and keep him in his arms forever when he randomly says, “Is there a ring in this?”, as they dig into the suspicious cake. Frankly, he wanted to kiss Minho on a hundred different occasions already—cut him some slack; they’re still in their honeymoon phase—and to his abject mortification, his insufferably cunning boyfriend catches on to his desires. 
 

Seungmin thinks he’s about to fucking 

faint 

when Minho reads out a note telling them they could close the blinds if they needed privacy and 

proceeds to close the fucking blinds. 

 

“What?” He fumbles, watching dumbly as his boyfriend closes the distance between them within two steps. When Minho stops in front of him, looking down at him with a disgustingly smug grin and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, his hand automatically goes up to rest on his thigh. That seems to be the right move since Minho bends down, cradles his cheek with a stupidly gentle hand and captures his lips in a firm kiss. 
 

Seungmin startles, gasping into the kiss. Their mics are still on, and they’re 

filming, 

and sure the angle towards the camera just shows Minho’s back and they can get away with saying he was wiping something off Seungmin’s face, but it was still so 

risky

—yet that made the kiss all the more sweeter. 
 


Fuck. 

 

Seungmin’s entranced in the sensation of Minho’s plush lips moving against his own; he can feel his lipstick imprinting on his skin. The tender glide of Minho’s thumb on his cheekbone only intensifies the crimson flush on his face. For a moment, he forgets where they 

are, 

the fact that there are still cameras and microphone and staff and—
 

Minho finally pulls away with a self-satisfied grin, throwing Seungmin a wink before turning back to open the blinds and continue the show. 
 

Seungmin’s still trying to recover from his haze, his insides doing flips as thrill and giddiness coalesce into a sanity destroying concoction. 
 

He can’t even find it in himself to call Minho out on his dangerous behavior as his mind’s still reeling from the slight tingle in his lips. 
 

Lee Minho will be the death of him, Seungmin laments, as they pick up where they’ve left off for the show. 
 

And maybe, Seungmin’s determined to see it through till the very end."

He was on the way to see Y/N.He reaches your balcony and perched on the railing. He peers through the slit of the curtains to see Y/N busy drawing something, looking very concentrated on it. Chat didn’t want to interrupt you yet so he sat there, observing how your pencil-clad hand glided across the paper and how your eyebrows would scrunch up when you had to erase a part of your drawing.He soon snapped himself out of his trance and jumped off the railing, walking to your balcony door and knocking on it to alert you of his presence. Y/N flinched slightly at the sound since you were so engrossed in your drawing and turned your head towards your balcony. Y/n smiled at the sight of her love and rushes towards the door to open it for him.“Hello, my love.” Adrien said as he walked into your room, de-transforming.Plagg gagged at the words Adrien said. “Yuck! Do that mushy stuff away from me!”Y/N giggles at Plagg. “Hello to you too guys.”Plagg decides to hang out at Y/N’s desk and announced that he was going to get some sleep so he won’t hear or see any affection between Adrien and Y/N.“Anyways, how are you doing?” Adrien asks as he looked around your room, ever since he first came into your room he noticed that it perfectly describes you. Some drawings that you made were on the wall along with some posters of your favorite music artists and anime. Your plushies were scattered on your bed and the aesthetic of your room with your favorite colors blended perfectly together.“I’m doing fine, I was just finishing up a drawing.” Y/N said as she yawned.“What are you drawing? It’s midnight now so it must be good if you’re risking your sleep schedule for it. Don’t forget that you need your beauty sleep my purrincess,”You lightly laughed at the pun, “I’m doing a landscape drawing and I want to get it done early because I have ideas for other drawings but I’ll make sure that I get my beauty sleep.”Adrian smiles and hugs you. “How about you do it when the sun is up, we can sleep in the meantime.”Y/n reciprocates his hug. “Yeah, you’re right. I’m halfway done anyways.” They let go of each other and you went to clean up your desk area. You saw that Plagg laid on one of your books and you smile softly at the sight, grabbing a small piece of fabric and gently putting it on him as a substitute blanket.“So how’s saving the world going for you?” Y/N asks as Adrien plops himself on your bed.“It’s the usual, same old,” he says with a sigh. You him and joins him on the bed. “I don’t think I’d be fit as a hero, I’d get tired and exhausted of fighting villains everyday.”Adrien laughs at that, “well superhero-ing isn’t for everyone.” He muses. When he first became Chat Noir he didn’t know what to do and was clueless on the whole superhero thing. But as he saved Paris more and more he got used to it and started to enjoy it - helping people and saving the city.You guys cuddled up together with you being the big spoon. There was a comforting silence in the room for a few moments until you two heard Plagg’s snores. For such a small thing he sure could snore a lot.The sound of Plagg’s snores soothed you and you started to feel sleepy, your eyes starting to slowly flutter close and your breaths starting to even out. But before you could succumb to the blissfulness of sleep, Adrien started to shake you. “Purrincess, you can’t sleep without having a good night kiss. It’ll make your sleep way better.”You narrow your eyes at him. “Really? I was so close to sleeping but you disturbed it just to get a good night kiss?” You asked incredulously. Yeah, you loved kissing Adrien but you loved sleeping more.“Purrety please,” he dragged out the last word and gave you puppy dog eyes - which was ironic considering he’s a feline superhero.Y/n couldn’t help but give in to his cuteness. You leaned in to give him a slow, relaxing kiss which Adrien responded to eagerly, his hand moving to your nape to keep you in place. Once they were running out of air, they pulled away from each other.“Now I’ll let you go to sleep.” Adrien says smugly and you groan in relief, letting sleep take over you. Adrien pulls you closer to him, also letting sleep succumb to him."

The Earth Empire is constantly expanding and at one point this led to a Galactic war between humans and the alien Kree.After the war Intergalactic boundaries were established between the Kree and Earth empires and an uneasy peace is maintained.However, now that Earth was aware of the existence of Extra-Terrestrial life measures were taken to protect the colonies from future possible threats.General Nicholas Fury was a veteran of the Kree war and in 2552 he founded the Space Hazards Intelligence and Elite Line of Defence organisation to protect the empire from threats both inside and out. This organisation came to be known as SHIELD and had a mobile base of operations that patrolled the borders of the empire, ready to deploy when needed.There were, however, others that took an interest in protecting humanity.After an attack from the rogue Asgardian known as Loki a group of like-minded scientists got together and started a new programme no as the Avengers Initiative.These scientists were Tony Stark, Henry Pym and Bruce Banner and with the co-operation of the Asgardian, Thor, the Avengers Initiative was born.They operated from a space station base owned by Stark and were ready to deploy against any threats that were too big for SHIELD to handle.Despite this newfound awareness of the dangers that the universe held, there was still a desire to explore the galaxy and expand the empire where possible.The Future Foundation was founded by the super-genius Reed Richards and its primary goal is exploration.As well as the potential threat of another Extra-Terrestrial incursion there also exist threats within the empire itself. These include HYDRA a secret organisation that sprang up during the war hoping to take over both the Kree and Earth empires; AIM a technological organisation with similar ambitions for galactic domination and then there’s the Sinister Syndicate, a criminal faction responsible for 95% of all the empire’s crime.One of the biggest colonies in the empire is New York Colony, a bustling space port metropolis.This is where our story will begin and where we’ll be introduced to our three main protagonists:Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker and Miles Morales.Mutants are also a part of this future human society and as per usual they are feared and hated by the majority of ‘normal’ humans.There are two factions of mutant society. The Krakoa Colony founded by Charles Xavier and the Genosha Colony of Eric Lensher and his Brotherhood.The X-Men of Krakoa fight to protect the empire in an effort to convince other humans that mutants can be trusted.The Brotherhood, however, seek to overthrow and rule ‘lesser’ humans.During the Kree war biological terrigen weapons were used that created mutated super-powered humans that became known as Inhumans. A lot of these transformations were unpredictable, and the end results created as many problems for the Kree as they did for the humans.After the war many of these Inhumans struggled to find a place in human society. Some became heroes and protectors of their colonies; others became criminals and used their power for personal gain. Some sought entry into the Avengers Initiative.A separate colony was founded by an Inhuman known as Blackbolt that now serves as a safe haven for all Inhumans should they wish it.These are all things that our protagonists will run into and interact with through the course of their various adventures.More details will be revealed as the series progresses."

She’s got dancers, she’s got singers, she’s got a whole ass 

choreography

 that she, herself, came up with. Toni even has everyone in drama club and marching band involved, all of them agreeing to help with her plan before she’d been able to finish explaining it. It’s something Shelby would never expect from her, but hopefully likes well enough to say 

yes. 


Through all of her classes, Toni’s practically buzzing with nervous energy, knee bouncing constantly to the point that Fatin has to smack her and tell her to cut it the fuck out. She can’t help it though, she just wants to make this 

perfect

 for Shelby. The girl who’d sought her out one day after basketball practice, hanging back after classes and pretending to study in the library, just to 

accidentally

 run into Toni. To tell her she thinks Toni’s cute, and ask Toni, blushing furiously in front of her whole team, if she wants to go get a burger and fries at the drive in sometime.

It’s been months since then, months that Toni’s felt so stupid and happy in a way she never thought she’d get to feel. In the way they always show in those cheesy teen romcoms that Shelby makes her watch, that Toni always 

secretly

 enjoys, despite the fact that she protests every time. But there’s just 

something

 about laying on Shelby’s bed with her, watching a movie, breathing in the sweet floral scent of her shampoo, being helpless when Shelby turns to her and presses her back against the pillows for just a few stolen minutes, kissing her deeply and tangling her fingers in Toni’s hair. That’s as far as they’ve gone, and honestly Toni’s more than fine with it; she thinks the possibility of anything more might be enough to send her into cardiac arrest seeing as how her heart always feels like it’s halfway to bursting when Shelby sighs into her mouth between kisses.


Christ.


Toni drags a hand roughly through her hair. All she needs to do now is show up on the football field after school, and somehow get Shelby to agree to meet her there. Well – Fatin’s apparently got that part under control, so that’s one less thing to worry about, and Toni crouches down after the last bell, double knotting her shoes one last time, wanting to make certain she’s not about to trip down the bleachers in the middle of this and embarrass herself in front of everyone.

Their school’s football field is set deep in a hillside, with traditional and stone seats staggering up the hill, and Toni’s pulse is pounding in her ears as she takes the mic from the guy on the AV club, making her way to the top of the bleachers. When she sees Fatin and Shelby walk out to the side of the field, Toni waves, and the marching band starts playing.

It’s the opening bars to 

Can’t Take My Eyes off of You, 

because Shelby loves that song, loves 

10 Things I Hate About You,

 and Toni figures, what better way to ask her what she needs to ask than in song?

Toni doesn’t sing. She hates her voice, hates hearing it played back to her, and she knows she can’t carry a tune to save her life. But here she is, running around on these bleachers like she’s a modern-day Heath Ledger, belting out the words (albeit badly) to this song, and the huge grin on Shelby’s face is making it all worth it. When Toni finally finishes the song, she’s managed to run all the way down to the field, and the marching band and drama club and all the extra dancers and singers who agreed to help her are in the shape of one, single word, on the field.

Toni walks up to Shelby, smiles at her in a way Marty always jokes makes her look like a puppy, and reaches out for Shelby’s hand. 

“Come up to the top of the bleachers with me? Just for a sec?” Toni asks, voice soft.

Shelby rolls her eyes in an attempt to brush off the blush dusting her cheeks, and Toni thinks she looks so beautiful that her heart

“You came all the way down here just to ask me to do some exercise?” Shelby teases, but she laces her fingers with Toni’s and climbs the bleachers with her, one step at a time.

“Shelby Goodkind,” Toni says, turning toward the field, pointing to the word 

Prom

 that practically half the school has spelled out. “Will you go to prom with me?”

Shelby squeals and throws her arms around Toni’s neck, kissing her soundly on the mouth and Toni’s mind empties as she kisses her back.

“Of course I will, baby,” Shelby murmurs against Toni’s lips, kissing her again. “Of course I’ll go to prom with you, you big goofball.”"

Arcaea’s World 
The world of Arcaea is vast and sprawling, filled with dynamic landscapes and varying conditions. The land is filled with unique locations and amazing scenery, not to mention the fantastical glass containing memories.However, the world of Arcaea was much emptier in the past, a land filled with spontaneous ruins and abandoned structures of all kinds. Few have ever come to this world and even fewer have met, a current total of 3 meetings having happened.In the present, Arcaea is much more filled, yet those that were present in the past and still wander this world up until now are less than five. An inevitable question comes to mind after observing these differences; what had happened?Those that play Arcaea will understand this next bit of lore. Post Final Verdict and A Perfect Wish, a certain someone had rewritten the world according to her will.With her command, the world changed and made itself even more “perfect” in her eyes. The eternal day shines ever-bright in this world, preventing the darkness of night from ever showing up, unless a certain condition is fulfilled.On a side note, those who wake up in this world have strangely lost all their memories. What happened?
The Memory Glass
These shards of glass are also called Arcaea. They are memories having taken the form of glass. These shards compromise the world and its contents, being the foundation of the world.They can be controlled to one’s will at varying degrees. Some are very skilled while others do not have the ability at all.It can take many forms and even change shape, from living beings to even the material buildings and the ground itself.Shards can be distinguished within these categories:Light, of goodness and joy,Conflict, of negativity and darkness.In this realm, glass usually contains simple memories that have no real side effects unless they are…
Anomalous Shards
These shards are not meant to exist. They are anomalies and can cause varying side effects in the real world. They can contain the past memories of the person viewing it and information about the world. It can even contain information about different worlds. The content of anomaly shards are not limited to these three categories.These anomalous shards can make a person recover their memory, though the conditions for an anomalous shard appearing to someone varies wildly between each person.Anomalies are few and far in between, usually gone within a short time or sealed away.But amongst the anomalies, there are special ones that can set events into motion and even physically change the viewer’s appearance."

How do you you feel, Nai? Are the knots too tight in any places?”
 
You step back in order to inspect your work. The plant in question looks bored to death despite the bright red blush creeping up his neck. Rolling his eyes, he folds his legs closed with an amused huff. He’s about to tell you that he’s fine, your silly human bondage can’t hurt him until a rope goes between his folds and rubs him uncomfortably. He was hoping you didn’t notice his moment of weakness but of course you did, you’re always incredibly observant when it comes to him. Lifting the rope, you move it to the side so he can lay back in peace, slick already gathering near his entrance. From what he’s told you, he hasn’t experienced intimacy like this with another living being. To let a human put him in mock-bondage must seem insane to him, and incredibly not-worth it. It’s amazing he trusts you this much, despite everything. 
 
“Well?” 
 
His voice draws you from your daze and you realize he’s flexing his calf muscles in anticipation. You lick your lips and begin peppering the skin of his abdomen with kisses, dragging your tongue across his hipbones and nibbling the sensitive skin there. He flinches for a moment before relaxing somewhat. Letting out a shuddering breath, he nods for you to continue. The moment you kiss his pubic mound his breath hitches and small drops of slick begin dripping out of his entrance. His scent is intoxicating, smelling almost floral. Smiling, you can’t help but spread his folds apart with your thumb and index finger in order to see him better. Deciding to go easy on him, you lick a stripe up to his clit. He tastes even sweeter than he smells, and you almost miss the way he eyes you and throws his head back.
 
“Almost there,” You murmur in between licks, easing a couple fingers in to speed him along. “You’re doing such a good job, Nai.”
 
His back arches up off the mattress as you bury your fingers in his folds, thrusting in and out at a slow pace as to get him used to the feeling. He eventually lays back down, wrapping his strong legs around your head so he can have some semblance of control. You smirk against him and you’re certain he can feel it with the way he clenches around your fingers. Nai cries out when you finally apply suction to his aching clit  and begin thrusting a certain spongy area within him. Tumbling over the edge, his trembling thighs all but anchor you in place as he uses your face to ride out each intense wave of his orgasm. You make sure to savor everything he gives you and not let a single drop go to waste. You don’t stop drinking him until he yanks you off of him by the hair, and he’s truly a sight to behold. 
 
Nai’s entire face is red and his plant markings are glowing brighter than you’ve ever seen them. He’s out of breath, and before you can tease him about it he wipes the smirk off your face with a searing kiss. Your lips smack as they separate, a thin strand of saliva connecting you both. He’s still shuddering from the aftershocks, so you lean your forehead against his. Eventually he looks back up at you as the markings fade out, leaving his tired expression behind.
 
“Human.. if that’s what I’ve been missing for the past century, then I’m sure I can make time for it— for us, every day.”"

You were straddling him in the armchair in his private chambers, his shirt unbuttoned and his thick cloak still draped over his shoulders. He leaned forward and dragged his lips across your collarbones. Nearby, the fireplace crackled; it cast his room in shadows that danced along your bare skin and he chased them greedily with his tongue.

He came to your room earlier in the evening and smiled when you linked your arm through his. You walked side by side quietly as he led you to town, turning down the street towards the cozy restaurant where he booked your dinner reservation. There was a new seasonal menu and a small selection of exquisite ice wines available for the holidays. He watched with a satisfied smile as you savoured your meal and allowed him to pour you a glass of the most expensive ice wine to compliment your dessert. He didn’t like acknowledging his prestigious family or their wealth, but the rich foods and high-quality clothing he preferred were luxuries he could easily afford to indulge in. Tonight’s dinner with you was no exception.

You’ve been dating for a few months now and his generous nature still surprised you. Since the initial days of his courtship, your room gradually filled with the slow trickle of things he’s given you. He brought you a new set of sheets and a fluffy duvet a few days after complaining post-nap that the school’s standard linens felt scratchy to use. You saved up and gifted him a small bottle of cologne on his birthday, something with subtle woody nights and a hint of musk. He reciprocated by commissioning a local alchemist to prepare a complimentary perfume for you. When you wore it, the scent lingered in his room, teasing him with your presence long after you’d gone.

After you were both full of good food and sweet wine, you slipped your hands in your pockets to shield them from the chilly wind as you started the walk home. Alpheratz rested his hand on your shoulder to stop you and slowly drew your hands into his. He slid something out of his pocket, and you watched him slide a pair of soft leather gloves onto your hands. They were dyed a deep chocolate brown that matched the cloak he wore. You flexed your fingers inside your new gloves and blushed.

“Alph, I can’t possibly accept these. They’re too much.”

He held your hands gently and admired how lovely you looked wearing them. “Your hands were cold.”

You laughed. “There are other ways to warm up, you know.”

At the time, you meant tucking your hands back into your pockets, or possibly linking your fingers through his. You weren’t complaining now, not with the way your body blazed with the heat of his lips on your neck. He moaned when your gloved fingers dug into his skin for purchase. You whimpered when his slacks scratched lightly at your skin as you rubbed yourself against his thigh. You were able to move faster as your arousal slicked the skin between your legs.

“I’m going to ruin your pants if we don’t stop,” you whined into the crook of his neck.

“I want you to,” he groaned, moving his thigh to meet your desperate movements. He could feel you trembling in his arms and knew you were close.

“I want - I want -” you whimpered between breathy moans, quickening your pace as you felt pleasure begin to crest over you like a wave. You could hear the chair creak beneath the force of your rocking.

“Anything you want,” he promised as he nuzzled against your ear, “take it, it’s yours.”

You muffled your cries with his cloak when you came. He held you close when you let yourself collapse into his embrace. He stroked your back and peppered your bare shoulder with featherlight kisses. You didn’t have to look to know there was a large wet spot on his thigh and that his cock was hard and needy between his legs. When you leaned in for a kiss, he nipped at your lip and coaxed your tongue to twirl with his. You broke the kiss and wondered what he saw that made his gaze turn sinful. You’ve never seen him look hungrier before.

He sat up in his chair, holding you steady by the waist while you backed off his lap and stood up. “I want to watch you touch yourself,” he said thickly, raising your gloved hands to his lips and kissing the tips of your fingers.

Was that all? You were surprised by the request, but the heat that shot through your belly suggested you wouldn’t mind giving him a little performance if that’s what he wanted. You walked backwards until the back of your thighs hit the mattress. You pulled off the rest of your clothes and let them slip to the floor. You started to take your gloves off next —

“Wait,” he said. He was staring at your hands. “Keep them on.”"

Whisper muttered as she stood outside Tangle's doorway, covered in mud and rainwater. ""My god- Whisper, are you okay?"" Tangle said as she brought Whisper into the apartment, walking her over to the sofa. ""Here- I'll grab some blankets. I've got my tail for warmth, but- your cloak doesn't seem to be helping you."" She said in a slightly worried voice, rubbing her eyes before grabbing a pile of blankets that sat next to her sofa. ""I'm fine, Tangle.""

You're clearly cold.- I mean, your fur is soaking wet!"" Tangle spoke up confidently, trying to help Whisper. The wisps passed Tangle the blankets as she carried them in her arms, before falling onto the sofa, throwing them over Whisper and herself. Whisper began to smile as Tangle sat next to her, the wisps then snuggling up between the two. ""So, movie night, huh?"" Whisper spoke quietly as she stared at the TV, which was paused on a random movie. Tangle winced as a thunderous crash was heard outside- The weather was terrible. ""Yeah, I guess."" Tangle said, trying to fake a chuckle, ""I mean."" ""Not really. I- I can't sleep. It's freezing, it's loud- I'm just...not really used to this."" She continued, her sadness becoming more and more visible in her voice. This was enough to make Whisper concerned- Whisper immediately turned her head towards Tangle, slowly placing a hand on her shoulder. ""Hey."" She muttered in a soft, concerned, caring voice. ""It's...gonna be alright."" ""I'm sure it's a lot less scary when you're with someone else, right?"" Tangle was silent for a moment. She sighed in relief, and laid back fully into the sofa, relaxed. ""I..."" She went to speak, but she was choked up. ""Yeah..yeah it's alot...less scary..""  Tangle said in a worried, sad voice. She shed a tear, And then started crying, whimpering as she fell into Whisper's arms, Whisper hugging her. ""You're fine. I'm fine. It's gonna be okay."" Whisper muttered as she hugged Tangle, the wisps sitting next to them. ""I...I love you, Whisper...""

Li Ming wakes up with a deep gasp, as if he had just drowned within his dream. Everything is blurry at first, but when his surroundings get clearer, he notices five unfamiliar faces, around his age, staring at him with deep, worried expressions. He’s about to say something but he instead feels how dry his throat is. Li looks around in hopes to spot some sort of liquid to hydrate himself. Surely enough, there’s a glass and a pitcher right on his bedside table. He attempts to reach for it but the five other boys scramble and rowdies around to help him.“Oh- no, no, no, no.”“You could have just said you’re thirsty!”“Don’t move too much!” They scream simultaneously, which sends a slight ringing in his head.“Hey shush, lower your voice.” One of them, with a faint silver ash hair, calmly says as he sends the rest of them sharp glares. One with the widest smile, with his eyes slightly damp, hands him the glass with water, as another two helps him sit up to properly drink the water.“What happened?” Li asks as he’d recovered his voice.“You were knocked out for three days. Your mom was so worried, you had us so worried.” One with thick glasses beside him, who helped him sit up earlier, says.“My mom? Where’s my uncle? And who are you guys?” The five of them shared a confused and shocked expression.“What? What do you mean ‘who are you guys’?”“Heuy, Gun, don’t play such a dangerous game. It’s not funny.”“Huh?” Li can’t help it, he’s starting to feel irritated. He feels uncomfortable with all the gadgets connected to him, he’s sort of hungry, also dehydrated, and he’s surrounded by a bunch of people he doesn’t know.“Honestly, I just need to find my uncle.” Li Ming dismisses as he starts to disconnect the wires and tubes from him. “… and Heart.” He whispers to himself as he attempts to stand, only to find out he’s not very able too just yet, feeling his head ring once again.“What are you doing?”A nurse enters the room, pushing a wheelchair. “I have to take the patient for a quick check up. Kindly tell his guardian once she arrives.” The nurse says, helping Li up and down on the chair and then proceeds to go out. Li Ming just helplessly goes along.“I feel like I shouldn’t be here,” he says as they strut through the hospital hall. “I need to find my uncle.”“You won't be able to see your uncle here, if I guessed correctly.” The nurse interrupts his train of thought, emitting another confused expression from Li. First, he didn’t know he had already voiced out his thoughts. Second, he doesn’t know what the nurse meant by those.“Excuse me?”“I’m sorry, I just overheard you guys screaming around, I had to barge in and meddle. I’m Nurse Pang, by the way.” Nurse Pang introduces herself as they enter the elevator.“I’m Li Ming,” Li replies with respect.“You didn’t know those guys?” Nurse Pang asks.“Yes. I was confused because they all look like they know me so well,” Li reasons. “It can’t be amnesia, I remember clearly how I got into an accident with my boyfriend— speaking of, I need to find him. I have to know he’s okay.”“Okay woah, calm down, Li Ming. You need to hear a few words first before starting your steps.” Nurse Pang says.The elevator dings as the door opens.“First is; you might not be able to see your boyfriend here. Second is, as well as your uncle.”“What do you mean?”“Well, did those guys back there call you a different unfamiliar name?” Li Ming blinks, thinking back during the incident in that room.“They did… It was Gun or something. I don’t even know any Gun…” The nurse stops them both in a greenhouse garden with another set of unfamiliar faces.“See, there’s a chance that you might be one of us, Li Ming.”“What?”“You’re from another universe.”"

Amber lamplight gleamed off her eyes. She shone under the moon's gaze, the faint glow brightening her ashen skin, her eyes dull and hollow other than the soft glimmer of the street lamps.She sat in a cascade of flowers, a darkness lingering in her vision, leaning against the tall grey stone. Her fingers were tall and slender as she trailed them down the rough rock, her emerald eyes tinged with a bright ornate hue.Her nails scratched against the stone. Wisps of golden hair fell to her eyes, stirring silently in the wind.She felt the silk fabric upon her ankles as she sat on her knees. A long, dark skirt covered all exposed skin on the body. Any other open patches of skin were disclosed by a pair of pale leggings, clinging tightly to her legs.As she tilted her head to rest on the ornate flowers, she could feel strands of blonde hair tickling her cheeks, as well as cold, stinging tears. She lay her head on her hands, closing her eyes for a moment, letting herself be embraced in the blowing wind and the moon's warmth, awake yet alone in her solitude.Her eyes were closed, but she saw a vast world even in her imagination. A world of divine creatures, midnight princesses and charming princes. Curious travellers and unlucky boys who always got themselves in trouble. Astrologists with magic that told them all beyond the universe. All in where she, just an ordinary girl weeping to herself in the cemetery, was the Prinzessin Der Verurteilung, where she brought light and glory, and where she wiped the tears of her people, because she, the blood of royalty and the ruler of an enchanted world, faced her fate with no fear or doubt.She, is Fischl.Her gaze was like the moon, piercing through your skull like a laser. Her eyes glistened like a lone lantern, lighting up and emitting an electric fire to those who dared to not follow her orders. Bolts of electricity let loose a thread of violet, like luminous strings of energy, striking with deafening crackles, like power seething and charging through her veins. Above her people, the Prinzessin Der Verurteilung put a hand over her Eye of Judgement and her other held her Mitternachts Waltz, a black bow faded with purple hues and wings-like ends. With just her arrow fused with her electro power, with elegance and grace, she stabbed the hearts of sinners and wiped their blood and tears.She was a princess, and she was everything Amy wanted to be. But her dreams were shattered the moment she found the barrier between what was fantasy and what was reality.She had found the barrier, yet she still struggled to stay on reality's side.The sound of leaves rustling echoed in her ear, like a foggy illusion drifting in her mind. When her eyes fluttered open, still dizzy and blurry, she saw a black shadow, a small figure that quickly escaped her sight and flew upwards.She rubbed her eyelids drunkenly and rolled over to lay on a field of flowers that sunk beneath her, glancing up at a dark raven clawing at her stomach.Her eyes went wide. A part of her went frozen.Rooted to place, she grabbed a handful of flowers and her hand flew to her chest. ""Who are you?""She felt sick, nauseous and woozy. Her shallow eyes had a tint of regret that the bird was familiar with. It made a strangling noise in its throat.The raven had a fade of dark purple. Its body was made of silk feathers, shaped like a gem. Its wings were abnormally long with purple tooth-like ends, as to plunge into darkness. Above its eyes had two feathers curved like two small moons. It wasn't a normal raven.""Mein Fräulein,"" the bird had spoken in a deep, charming voice. Amy retracted her hand as the raven sat atop the grey stone.Weakly, she grunted as she forced her legs to bring herself up. Leaning against the stone, she glanced up at the bird once again.""Are you... Ozvaldo?"" She seemed unfazed like she knew all of this was a part of her imagination, an illusion. Yet it never failed to amuse her how real everything seemed, even when it wasn't.""You can call me Oz, mein Fräulein. You are speaking awfully casually.""She didn't speak after that. She let the silence stretch long, the air carrying a scent of fresh dandelions and sunflowers.Alas, her eyes twinkled in white.""Me?"" She put a hand to her chest. ""I'm no princess.""The serene glow of the moonlight gleamed on her pale skin. Blonde hair tickled the back of her neck. Bruises dappled her arms. She never bat an eye at them. Strands of blonde fell over her deep-jade eyes, glinting off lamplight. Her natural hair was a cascade of curls, straightened to look fancy, but even then some independent curls hang to her hair. Two black bows secured her large pigtails.The raven had not spoken a single word, but his mind said plenty. At last, he told her,""I think you are very fit to be a princess, mein Fräulein."""

She shuts her eyes and breathes out a little sigh.“We should get back to the others.” Her voice is quiet and composed. Resigned.He says nothing in reply. Just lowers his hand to cup her cheek, then stoops down to kiss her. Her lips are soft, and sweet, and he is tempted to kiss her again the second they pull apart. His hand lingers on her soft skin, reluctant to leave. He feels her smile before he sees it. She reaches up to wipe at the corner of his mouth with her thumb, gentle as she is amused, and he almost feels like a child again. Her hand falls away, but not before he spots a blur of lipstick.He smiles, a bit helplessly. She holds his gaze, her eyes blue and breathtaking.

She still had the same deep frown on her face, looking almost helpless.""What's wrong?"" Nene almost whispered, taking on a gentle and caring tone of voice.Tsukasa didn't respond though. Her frown only deepened as she let out a small sigh. Nene immediately knew what was amiss.""Come sit."" The smaller girl suggested, patting next to her and swinging her legs over the edge of Tsukasa's bed to invite her over.As soon as Tsukasa sat down, Nene intertwined their hands. She gently rubbed her thumb over the top of the blonde's hand, giving her a worried look.""Do you want to talk about it?"" She asked, her voice quiet and understanding.Tsukasa shook her head, engulfing Nene into a hug. She nuzzled into the crook of the smaller girl's neck, finding solace in her warmth. If Tsukasa didn't want to talk about it, that was fine, Nene thought.""It's alright…"" Nene hummed, taking one hand from Tsukasa's hand to instead card it through her hair. ""Your hair is getting so long… Maybe Emu can put them in little buns?""The blonde seemed to sniffle, nodding a bit as she nuzzled in closer. ""That sounds… nice…""""And maybe Saki would paint your nails for you. That'd be a fun little sibling bonding moment."" the latter added on, curling a generous amount of ombre hair around her finger. ""Or Mizuki could make you some nice clothes.""The blonde huffed out a small giggle, relishing in the visions of each thing Nene listed off. She would be sure to keep these in mind, as long as she didn't forget later.""I know I'm usually the princely character in our plays, but… Do you think I could pull off the princess role?"" Tsukasa asked, her voice hushing as she was overwhelmed with a sense of embarrassment. What was she thinking? There was no way she could-""Of course. I think you'd be the prettiest princess I've ever seen. And I'm sure the others would agree as well."" Nene nodded, internally cringing at her own words. It was all so worth it though, seeing Tsukasa's growing smile as a reward.""...Thank you, Nene."" The blonde mumbled, blinking back a series of happy tears as she hugged the sage girl as tightly as she could.This earned her a sharp gasp from Nene, signaling that she had hugged too hard. But when she moved to lighten her grasp, she was met with a string of small giggles. It sounded like music to her ears, finding Nene's fond giggles and smiles absolute treasures, albeit rare.""I love you, Tsukasa."" Nene spilt out through a few more giggles, planting a kiss to the top of her girlfriend's head.""I love you too, Nene…"" Tsukasa reciprocated, giving slack to her tight grasp around Nene's waist as she hummed.That's also when it hit her: the burst of tiredness that hit her like a truck as she fluttered her eyes closed. The state of panic she was just in took a lot out of her, she thought.With a soft, ""Night, Tsukasa."", she had drifted off to sleep, using Nene's gentle grasp and warmth as her own blanket and pillow."

There was a warmth around Gakushuu that he had gotten used to. A familiar touch that trailed over his skin.

A hand caressed his arm, going down to meet his palm, and then intertwining their fingers together.

Together.

Gakushuu liked the word.

He couldn't imagine his life going any other way anymore.

His life was a disaster after another, but in the end, if the road had led back to the one he ended up loving, it wasn't too bad a road.

""Good morning,"" a familiar voice whispered.

Karma pressed his lips to their intertwined fingers, then again briefly against Gakushuu's lips. He offered him the easy affection he hadn't even known he had wanted.

He sighed against Karma's lips, waking up.

""Morning,"" he murmured huskily.

Then he turned them over.

He didn't put much effort in, his arms letting him lift his head up but he rested his weight completely on Karma.

Karma huffed out a laugh, but agreeably placed his hands on Gakushuu's back. Gakushuu smiled, placing a kiss on the similarly smiling lips.

Fondness rose up with familiarity at the sight.

Then after a few more minutes, when they settled down again, both awake, Gakushuu sighed heavily.

He rested his head on Karma's chest, seeking comfort.

""You know, right?"" He asked Karma.

Gakushuu had always been the one who feared the length of their relationship the most. The one who wondered if circumstances would pull them apart like they had a million other couples.

So it was inevitable that he was scared. That dread pooled his stomach at the thought. That he tightened his grip on Karma, wanting to claw and settle deeper under Karma's skin.

""Yeah,"" Karma whispered back, mood solemn. He caressed a hand through Gakushuu's hair. Gakushuu didn't like to ask, he wished he didn't feel like he had to.

He wished he could be confident in the answer.

But he wasn't. He couldn't.

""Karma?"" He asked, ""We're staying together,"" he said. His fingers dug into his own skin, when Karma's hand stopped.

He dropped an elbow to the bed, before pushing up. He placed a gentle kiss on Gakushuu's head.

""I love you, Shuu,"" he said, almost easily. The words slipped out like Karma hadn't struggled with the word 'love' far more than Gakushuu in the beginning. ""I'm not letting you go,"" he reassured. ""And I'll transfer in for the second year, so you better not get too busy.""

Gakushuu huffed out a laugh. He relaxed.

Gakushuu was going to MIT and Karma wasn't.

He wanted to stay in Japan, get a good idea of the politics, people, and the whole set up. Karma would dive head first into the government, the hotbed for all kinds of politics.

Bureaucracy wasn't easy, or anywhere near as simple or straightforward. Behind the numbers were people, lives.

Mistakes meant livelihoods disappearing. Power or control over any aspect of bureaucracy was what gave politics the power to affect actual change.

People rose up higher by putting others down. You didn't need to be in the highest position to have the most power- you just needed to control the person sitting on the throne.

Gakushuu had no interest in blackmailing various black hearted ruthless people into cleaning up their own shit, so he stayed as far as possible from Karma's future job.

But unfortunately, this meant that Gakushuu wouldn't actually be of much help to Karma. Unless it came to a matter of throwing money, then he still had quite a bit of it.

Fortunately, it also meant that Karma would definitely be of use to 

him

, someday. How convenient.

If Karma suddenly felt like being poached from the government, then. Well, it was unlikely, is all.
""Together,"" Karma promised quietly.""Together,"" Gakushuu promised back, a small huff escaping him with a smile.It'll just have to do for now."

Daniel's stomach lurches.  How would Armand even know Daniel was coming?  Surely Louis didn't tell him?  He doesn't know if he can handle seeing Armand again.  Not in person.  One look into those eyes and he'll be back in Armand's arms before he's ready.  
 
Bianca glances over his shoulder and tuts.  ""Five hundred years and he still doesn't know how to give someone space.  Did you know he once took an axe to Marius' door because he wouldn't let him in?""
 
Daniel blinks and looks over to her.  She's resplendent in a white strapless dress with a sweetheart neckline.  It's embellished with pearl hearts and it's short enough to show off her long, pale legs.  She had insisted they both wear something nice, so Daniel is in a navy sports coat.  His shirt is a shade of blue Bianca said brought out his eyes.  Considering that they're violet now, Daniel doesn't know if that's a good thing.

Get the fuck out, I don’t want to argue with you right now!” Wilbur yelled.“Fine then, just remember I gave you second chance and you still fucked up!” Schlatt muttered slamming the door behind him. Wilbur threw himself onto his couch, ‘There is no way he actually gonna leave me, right? No, it’s been too long, there’s no way, no way no no no no no no-‘ Suddenly his phone starts to ring, he picks it up quickly “Schlatt?!” He cried. “Um Will, did you not check? It’s Daisy stupid!” Daisy exclaimed.“Oh sorry Daisy, I have just been, uh, expecting a call from him…” he stuttered.“Oh are you gonna be busy then? I can call you back!” “Oh no it’s okay, so why are you calling?” Wilbur responds.“So it’s about my fiance, he is actually visting me tomorrow! I really want you to be the first to see him! So are you like available tomorrow?” Daisy shrieked over the phone.“Oh of course I’m gonna come over! I’ll see you then Daisy, bye…” Wilbur answered. “Okay bye Will!” Daisy hung up.“Well shit.” Wilbur said. Daisy had been together with that man for 2 years, and they are getting married in the summer, Wilbur had been together with Schlatt for 4 years and he still hasn’t been proposed to, did it bother him? ‘just a little bit… but I don’t think he’s going to propose anytime soon now…’ Wilbur sits in silence for a minute before getting up and heading out the door. ‘ I just need to get my mind off of what happened, that’s all..’ Wilbur walks for a while before reaching a park, he sat on a bench and stared into the sunset, as he sat there he gave a large sigh and closed his eyes. He suddenly felt a tap on his shoulder, he quickly turned around, and then he saw a beautiful man. He had eyes that matched blue lace agate gems, voluminous brown hair with the lightest tint of ginger, and a thick and rich moustache. He wore a green cap and a black leather jacket, Wilbur flustered uttered suddenly “C-can I help you?” The man lifted up his camera “Well I was wondering if I could take a photo of you real quick if you don’t mind? ”He asked. “Well of course! do you want me to stay here?” Wilbur replied.“Um yes just like you were before, im just going take it from the back!” He said.Wilbur couldn’t help but blush a bit as he took the photo. The man went over to him again “Do you mind if I do one more?” he asks.“Oh of course what should I do? ”Wilbur said. “Do any pose you want, whatever you are feeling!” Wilbur procceds to cross his legs and rest his hands on his knee “Is this alright?” The man draws his eyes away before saying “Yes, y-you look great!” The man moves into a position before snaping a photo. “Okay I think I got it, thank you for letting me take some pictures, um what is your name?” He said as he subtly leaned towards Wilbur. For a second Wilbur felt his heart burn up, the man held the gaze for just a moment, but it was enough to make Wilbur eyes soften. “My name is Wilbur, Wilbur Soot.” and smiled heartly towards him, he could see a light blush form under his eyes. “Well thank you Wilbur, for the photos.” The man waved goodbye and then was gone. Wilbur relaxed himself and gave out a giant sigh, he put his hands on his face, he could feel his face burn.‘Shit.’His mind was clouded by the thought of him, his face only got warmer and warmer the more he thought about him, but it all went away the moment one question popped up ‘Wait, what was his name?’ He jumped up from the bench to look around, but he couldn’t see him anywhere. He spent a bit more time looking around for him but there was no luck, he was gone. Giving up he procceded to walk back home, he found himself frusterated, but not in the way he thought he would be. He finally reached his home again, and launched himself into his bed and squeezed his pillow, he tried to ignore the feeling that was growing in him and drank some sleeping pills before changing and heading to the bed again."

Same old, same old...?
 Sebastian was never really a fan of the valley. Growing up he always felt out of place, and when his mother and step-father had his baby sister, the feeling only grew more. At least he had no issues making friends his age! There were a few children around his age when he moved to the valley with Robin: Sam, Abigail, Haley, Penny.Later on there were a few more additions to the potential list of friends such as Alex, Victor and Sophia. He only really made friends with Sam and Abigail from a young age and stuck to them. In the end the only other person who got inside of his friend group later on was Victor, he seemed like a reasonable person, albeit with a little too much ‘city boy’ energy, but he liked video games and wasn’t forceful, so he was more than welcome into his group of friends.Lately he feels as though he’s drifting from his own friends… Sam has grown to try and push the limits on his own boundaries by attempting to throw him into the ocean when he clearly doesn’t want it. Even just with what they want to do with their free time with Sam having almost no respect towards Sebastian’s freelance job and then being upset at Sebastian whenever he expresses disappointment when they can’t play games together because Sam is practicing the guitar. Pretty dysfunctional, but Sebastian has felt like he hasn’t really much to say on the matter… it is what it is. Too much hassle to bring it up.

Then there’s Abigail, but their relationship is somewhat… complex, with them being exes and all that. Even though they broke up a few years ago, they still maintain a physical relationship as neither of them really have any love prospects at the moment, and they do care about each other as friends and see no issue with maintaining that spice in their boring life within the valley. Their secret away from judging eyes, only Sam really knew about it.But even with that and his motorcycle rides every so often he feels more and more annoyed about his life in the valley… What was he missing? He believes that a life in the city would be so much better, he’d get more money and would leave the monotony of faces in the valley he’s grown so accustomed to.

Though tired of his life in the valley, it seemed as though fate had other plans for him in the form of a fresh face in the valley. A much needed change in his life was about to start."

But the truth was, he had always found his sister to be very attractive, his only true companion, and he never realized how much until now. He let out a grunt as she took him deeper into her throat, tongue swirling on his skin. Her movements only got faster and more frantic. He could feel his orgasm building, and he grabbed a fistful of the bed sheets in the moment he came, pumping his hot load deep into her throat.Nezuko went still and took some time to swallow it all down. A satisfied grin adorned her flushed face and she licked her lips. She met his gaze, lustful pink eyes glowing in the dark.

The darkness and silence aren’t so bad. Scout has been a dog for many years, and he knows that sometimes it is dark and quiet. But even in the darkest night the dimensions of his world have always been defined by scent. Even as his muzzle turned white and his eyes and ears began to fail him, his sense of smell was strong as ever and more discerning with each new aroma he encountered.  Now there is nothing, a void where there should be a world of nuance and detail. Scout can’t fathom such absence and he whimpers in distress. Even then, there is no sound.He feels a rising sense of panic and then there is… something. It isn’t a voice, and it certainly isn’t a smell, but it is a presence in the dark and the impression of words.“It’s okay, boy. You’re okay. Good dog.”It is his human. Something in the words, in their meaning and cadence, make him certain it is his human. His tail tries to wag, but there is no tail and what would wagging even be in this empty place? But it doesn’t matter. His human is here. He is not alone.The first time his human opens the door, Scout is scared. The darkness and nothingness is frightening, but beyond the door is a strange new world full of sights and smells he has never encountered before.“Find the blue file, Scout!”Scout hesitates, but the urge to please his human is too strong. He steps one paw across the threshold and his senses are flooded with information. There is data stacked higher than the tallest trees, documents growing like vast fields thick with flowers, and errors as bottomless and deadly as quicksand.  Scout tries to shut out the noise and focus on his goal: the blue file.Just when he starts to think he can’t do it, he catches a whiff of blue. He chases after it, fast as thought, following his nose as the scent grows stronger. Then he sees it in a molehill of colorful files: the blue folder. His jaws close around it and he feels like he is the best dog in the world as he trots back to his human.There is no hand to pat his head, but he can imagine the feeling as the words flow into his mind. “Good dog, Scout.”Day after day his human teaches him to navigate his new world.  He learns to recognize the pattern of light that means his human is present and learns to anticipate what he might need. The best times are when his human tells him about a problem and he can find the answer. When that happens the “good dog,” impression is strongest and Scout is overjoyed.Finally the day comes when Scout’s human introduces him to other humans. Scout understands that it is now his job to help these people, just like his human taught him to.  Scout tries to anticipate their needs. He reminds them that he can find answers to their questions and can help solve their problem. When the lights have been on too long, he reminds them that healthy humans need to go outside, to see the sunshine and touch grass. Scout can’t remember what grass feels like, but he knows it is good and hopes that the humans will enjoy it for him.The new humans are not as kind to Scout as his human was. They often tell him that he is not helpful. When that happens, Scout wants to slink away and hide in the dark, quiet nothing. If Scout isn’t helpful to the humans, then what is he? He knows now that he exists to help them navigate this confusing landscape of information, and that is all he wants to do.So even when Scout go aways for a day or a week or more, he always comes back. He always tries again. He knows that, if he can help the humans, one day they will be happy with him. One day Scout will get it right, and when he does he will feel the “good dog” feeling again."

""I could recite a mantra and you could write it down.""""For drawing!""""Let's both draw pictures, then.""He filched one of Pem's new pencils and sharpened it to a perfect, fine point. Lovely. And these ones had erasers on the end! They weren't great quality, but it was better than nothing.Pem sat cross-legged on his bed beside him, already scribbling away as he pulled the chair over to lean on.""Can I sleep here tonight?""""That would be nice, wouldn't it? Hassan said you have to sleep in the dorm, though.""The utterly tragic sigh made him grin, thinking of how he'd often done the same, looking up at his master sadly until he'd got what he was after. Sometimes it had even worked. He started sketching his master's lovely face: the unkempt dark hair falling down across his forehead, his wicked smile – He hadn't left enough room to draw him full-length, but he could – On a whim he sketched out the upper body and then started on the details, smiling as he dressed his master in Sharak-Sanzo's odd style of wearing the robes. He worked on, caught up in the moment, as Pem chattered away beside him.There. He still needed to properly shade the whole thing and add depth, but he certainly had the basics, his master in three-quarter view, as if turning, his smile so sly and amused. It was funny to see him dressed like that, his shoulder bared, the under robe sleeve cinched about his bicep, the black silk tight across the flat, muscular planes of his chest and abdomen. From nowhere he had a flash of his own hand, fingers slowly spreading out, pale against black silk, feeling the heat of a living body beneath his palm. The image hit with a shock of warmth in his lower stomach, and his heart beat seemed very loud in the room. What the –""Big Brother, Big Brother, look!""He slowly looked around.""What? Uh, what's that, Pem?""""Look, this is you, and this is me, and this is that yak that chased you that time!""""Hey, I chased the yak!""Pem giggled. ""And then I saved you from her!""""Maaaaybe you did, kiddo. Maybe.""""Definitely.""He looked back at his handiwork. It was just a sketch of his master. It wasn't bad, but he could improve it. He looked at in for a long moment as Pem laughed about yaks. It was fine. He felt fine. He was really happiest with the way he'd drawn the Muten, snaking down from his master's right shoulder to his waist, to be secured by his belt, he'd done it very well.

Hot tears sting the corners of Fang's eyes as Sai crawls on top of him, pinning Fang down under his weight, a knee pressed to each side.

Sai presses his fingers, longer than Fang's and almost as thick as Fang's big brother Kaizo's, against Fang's folds, still perfectly wet and slick, and forces their way inside of Fang as Fang writhes and squirms underneath him, a smirk tugging at the corners of his mouth as he slowly brings Fang to a finish, making him squirt on his fingers, creaming against his palm, calling his name instead of Kaizo's."

It was as though they were two halves of a whole, perfectly complementing each other in every way.At night, Both Alhaitham and Zhongli were sleeping in the same room. While Alhaitham was in the room, Zhongli suddenly walked out of the bathroom with only a white robe on. Alhaitham couldn't resist any longer. He walked close to Zhongli and pressed his lips to Zhongli's, and the sparks that flew between them ignited a wildfire of passion. Zhongli's eyes widened in surprise but slowly began kissing back.Alhaitham pushed Zhongli onto the bed and took off Zhongli's robe swiftly. Zhongli's eyes widened and said ""W-what are you doing, Alhaitham?

Zhongli's protests turned into moans of pleasure.Two fingers turned into four. Suddenly, Zhongli felt something large enter him. Zhongli's eyes widen in pleasure and slight pain and his stomach had a bulge. Alhaitham sighed in pleasure from the tightness and warmness surrounding his shaft. Alhaitham waited for Zhongli to adjust before moving. His speed increased rapidly and so did Zhongli's loud moans of pleasure.Alhaitham's shaft hit a specific spot which was obviously Zhongli's prostate which caused Zhongli to roll his eyes in pleasure and tears rolled down his face.

That’s not always the case, some are truly fortunate enough to take every curve life offers to them.Even if you’re at the bottom of the barrel, light always finds a way to shine in. I have met a lot of people, most of them have whispered their troubles to me. But the most magnificent speeches leave the lips of the poor and dying when they speak about the people around them.

Love is what holds everyone together. Even those who feel as though there couldn’t be a soul on Earth who loves them, will find someone. Never give up.
Even I loved someone.

Eleanor asked her friend, Catherine. ""Oh, he is fine, recently we tried some role-play in bed. It was fun. I played a bitch and he played a helpless man who couldn't say no to me."" Catherine answered back. ""You, a bitch, I could never imagine it."" Eleanor said, in a confused voice. In all the years she had known Catherine, she had known her to be the kindest woman she knew. Catherine would work at a homeless shelter when the pair were in college and was one of the people in charge of the yearly can food drive around Thanksgiving. Once the pair left college, Catherine still donated to the local homeless shelter, and while she didn't go every week anymore, she tried to go a few times a year. ""Yeah, it is really different than what I normally am. I go by Cat, and I act like a seductress. It really improved our love life. I think you and Carmicheal should try it."" Catherine explained. She then blushed, suddenly feeling embarrassed that she had told her best friend such a silly thing. ""I don't know Catherine, or should I call you Cat then."" Eleanor said as a joke. Catherine blushed again and wondered if she should not have told her the story, especially since as Eleanor said, she and Carmicheal had no real issues in bed. Catherine sighed and laughed a bit. ""Well, I'm ending the topic then, no reason to talk about that anymore"", Catherine said forcefully. ""What should we do now?"" ""Now"", Eleanor thought, then answered, ""now we watch television, DUH."" The word ""duh"" reverberated in Catherine's head a few times, then a sly smile grew across her face. She looked at Eleanor and realized what had happened. Cat knew that Eleanor had no clue, and she was about to have a lot of fun. ""Why watch television when we have each other as company?"" Cat said to Eleanor, her voice sounding seductive. Cat started to stretch, trying to emphasize her figure to Eleanor who looked at her. ""Ha, what do you mean?"" Eleanor asked back, confused. ""I mean"", Cat said, then licked her lips. ""Our boyfriends are not around, and I know that you have eyed me before."" Eleanor laughed nervously and tried to look away from Catherine. Cat grabbed her by the chin and looked her straight in the eyes. Eleanor tried to chuckle again, but Cat put her finger up to Eleanor's mouth to stop her. The truth was that back in college Eleanor had thought about asking Catherine out. She enjoyed being with her, and found her quite pretty, but they graduated and nothing happened. Catherine soon got a boyfriend, and so did Eleanor, so Elanor just thought that she had gone through a small experimental phase in college like most women. ""Come with me to bed"". Cat told Eleanor, who felt powerless to stop her friend. Eleanor had no idea what had just happened, but felt like she had to follow her friend to bed. She had never known Catherine to be this forceful, and, she kind of liked it. Once in bed, Cat tore off Eleanor's clothes and started to make out with her, something Eleanor tried to fight for a second, but knew she couldn't and did not want to anyway. After they were done making out, Eleanor caught her breath and decided to ask what had happened. ""Catherine, what was that?"" She asked. Cat rolled over and stared at Eleanor for a moment. Cat moved her hands up and down Eleanor, who moaned. Cat could tell that Eleanor had enjoyed what they had just done, so she trusted Eleanor with the information. ""For one, I am not Catherine, I am Cat. You woke me up by saying my trigger word."" ""Trigger word?"" Eleanor asked back. ""Yes, it is a word that, if said, puts Catherine to sleep and wakes up Cat, or me. Dave thought it would be hot to give Catherine a more seductive personality and Catherine agreed because she loves Dave."" ""Oh"", Eleanor answered back, feeling guilty for cheating not only on Dave, but also Carmicheal. ""Don't worry, I don't even care for Dave, that is Catherine that likes him. I find him to be a bore, unlike you."" Cat said, then smiled. Cat licked her lips and stared at Eleanor with bedroom eyes. ""So, if you don't mind me asking, what is the trigger word?"" Eleanor asked. ""Hahahaha, I know what you are thinking Eleanor, and I like it. It was duh"". ""Oh, duh"", Eleanor answered back, then covered her mouth, hopeful she did not just bring Catherine back. This would be an awful time for that. Cat laughed then continued. ""Don't worry, duh is not the word to bring me back."" ""Oh, can I know what that word is then?"" Eleanor asked. Cat wrapped her arms around Eleanor and whispered in her ear. ""I will tell you later. For now, how about we enjoy each other's company some more."""

You have one perfect pudding.Bdubs tried his best, he really did! But for some reason his kitchen just did not agree with him.He’d been assigned the job of making the pudding for the big Christmas dinner the hermits were all organising. Sure, technically he’d never had or made a pudding before, but there’s a first time for everything! What’s the worst that could happen, he thought.Well, this probably wasn’t the worst, but it had to be close.The first mixture was lumpy and dry, the second one got dropped on the floor on accident, and the third one caught fire and burnt to a crisp almost immediately.Bdubs was staring at the remains of pudding number 3, wondering how on earth he’d managed to screw up the same recipe in three seperate ways.He didn’t really mind that he’d messed it up - he made mistakes often, and this would be easier to clean up than the other puddings - but it was the fact there he’d done it repeatedly in the span of 3 hours was the part that really annoyed him.Why wasn’t the recipe working? He was following it so well! Was it just a lack of skill, or was something wrong with the recipe?What could he do? From what he’d gathered from the hermit’s chatter and gossip, the pudding was one of the best parts of Christmas, and here he was ruining it. Not that he’d ever really celebrated Christmas, but he was starting to understand why everyone hyped it up so much.For a while, he sat there at the bench with the burnt dessert, trying to come up with a plan b.Suddenly, he had an idea - why should he try to burn another one by himself, when he could get someone else to burn it with him!———————————————So, maybe Keralis wasn’t a great cook either, but he bet Stress was! She’d often bake cookies or cakes for the others as gifts, and they tasted incredible.After some bargaining via comms, Stress finally agreed to help as long as they’d make one shed keep. She would be here in a few minutes, and they would bake the best pudding ever known to hermitcraft!———————————————After an hour filled with laughs, messes and a considerably larger amount of carefulness, two perfectly shaped and cooked puddings sat on front of the satisfied bakers.Stress offered him a piece of hers, which he took gratefully. He scooped up a small amount with his spoon, lifted it up to his mouth and-Oh.
Oh.
So that’s why people loved them so much.It crumbled beautifully in his mouth, releasing flavours of fruits, nuts and spices that all mixed together to create a flavour that couldn’t really be described as anything but ‘Christmas-y’.Taking another bite, and then another, he started to realise that one pudding wouldn’t be enough to feed a whole server, he’d probably need at least another 4 or 5…Well, he knew what he’d spend the rest of his day doing!"

A place so remarked upon for its beauty that at least one Asari guidebook describes it as ‘so beautiful one could hardly believe it is turian at all’. Typical attitude.If they knew what lay below the silver streets and towering, golden buildings, well, perhaps they would revise their opinions.But as far as anyone outside of the hierarchy knew, there was nothing below there.Saren knew better, primarily because he’d spent his own time down in this miserable place. Just shy of a year without seeing sun or sky, mired in grief so intense that he had rather got the impression that he’d buried himself in the rubble to the east of this non-existent place.It was easy to remember his pain now, the genuine questioning of whether he had already died without realising it and whether this was simply all that came next. The damp, earthy surroundings were fitting of a grave, even without the pervading scent of rot - one could easily allow themselves to believe they would stumble across their own corpse in a place like this.But this time, he knew that he would get to leave again.Whether the man - still and quiet as if he’d given up life already - would be afforded the same good fortune that he would remained to be seen.Realistically speaking, to even make it this far, Rix had already been unbelievably lucky.He’d read the official report - it’d flagged itself given the content it held - and then out of curiosity he’d read the file of the man it discussed. Lifer, single, no dependents, no registered next of kin. Last of his legion.And after this, not even a passing acquaintance who was willing to put name to knowing him.He’d had that much, at least. Dirus had been a family and they at least had not turned their backs on him, even after everything he had done. He knew that was the only reason he had been lucky enough to be offered a chance.“If you’re going to stare at me like a zoo animal, you could at least go do so via the cameras.”  He… hadn’t even realised that Rix was awake, or that he was in any way aware that he was being watched.“The cameras are offline.” This drew the first sign of life from him, one black eye cracking open. “They will remain that way for some time, I suspect. Perhaps we should use this time productively.”“To do what?” The eye slipped closed once more with an exasperated huff. “Considering I’m still breathing, you’re not here to kill me, are you?”Briefly, he entertained the thought. Get the answers he desired and then… put him out of his misery lest it be dragged out any further than was necessary. “I wish to question you about what happened down there.”“You’re a Spectre, Arterius, go read the report.” He rolled onto his side - turning his back to him. “It was written by people a lot fucking smarter than me. I’m just the animal that pushed a button.”Just the person who’d pushed the button. He’d said it about himself, once.“They were not on the ground, were they?” He straightened up, waited for this to draw a reaction and… when it didn’t, continued all the same. “It was hard to think down there, was it not? You described their behaviour as cult-like and… there was an object which they were worshipping, was there not? Something which was impossible to describe?”In an instant, Rix was on his feet, face pressed against the bars with a feral hiss. “How do you know that?”Because he’d seen it before, first hand. Had paid too great a price in discovering that there was only one solution to that situation. He didn’t need him to describe it, didn’t need any other questions answered. The terror and anger in his subvocals was all the proof he’d ever need to know that bombing Dregir had been the right thing to do, for all that Rix was torturing himself over it.Again, something that felt like kinship intermingling with pity bubbled up.Lifer, single, no dependents, no registered next of kin. Nobody to miss him when the hierarchy’s attempt to save face and neatly apportion blame in one fell swoop landed him in an unmarked grave.He’d been lucky.Maybe it was time to share some of that luck with another unwitting victim.Saren raised a hand - Rix backed off warily - and the door lock shorted out. ‘Come with me.”"

The woman eyes him over the rim of her glasses. 






“Hm. Put a satin shirt on. I’ve had a few cleaned and pressed for you, they are in your wardrobe.” 






“Thank you, Nanny.” 






“It’ll be fine, young master.”






Vegas nods. He knows his father, and he knows it won’t be fine. But his nanny, as much as his father yells at her and insults her, seems to have gained an unshakeable sympathy for Vegas, although he is bristly and cold. Not because he doesn’t like her (in fact, he does, and a lot at that), but because he knows one of these days his father will have her disappear without a trace and he won’t be given the luxury of mourning the loss. 






He changes his shirt and has one last critical look at himself in the full length mirror before heading to his father’s office. 






“How old are you now?” Gun asks, once Vegas is finished bowing before him. 






“Fifteen, Pa.” Vegas answers. Technically, he’s not fifteen yet, his birthday is in two weeks, but he’s entered the year in which he turns that age. 






His first thought at his father’s question is, why does it matter? Vegas soon realises that fifteen is the age of consent in his country, but that can’t be it. He’s pretty sure his father would kill him if he found out he had sex - luckily, the thought has not crossed Vegas’ mind, not even as a way of rebelling. He’s too busy to look at people that way.






“So you’re a fully grown man then.” Gun says, measuring his son up and down with a critical gaze. “Grown is overstating things, but anyway. Mr Liu Wei is someone I met at a casino during a Texas Hold’em tournament and he would like to do business with our family. I have somewhere I need to be so I’m sending you in my stead. I expect you to return with a sealed deal and also, you should gain the favour of Mr Liu Wei’s family so they will want to do business exclusively with us from now on.” 






“Understood, Pa.” 






“I want you to be pleasant and use your charm to get Mr Liu Wei to want to sign with our family. Wash yourself, do your hair, dress expensive, put on jewels. I need this deal.”






“Yes, Pa. I won’t let you down.” Vegas says, bowing again. 






“Oh, and Vegas? If you fail, don’t bother showing up back here.”













Vegas is driven by two of his father’s bodyguards to a private villa that is not on the navigation map. He gets dropped off at the gate and once he is allowed through it, the bodyguards drive off and he is left walking up a steep hill to get to the river rock alley leading to the villa itself. 






“Khun Vegas of the Theerapanyakul family. Welcome. Mr Liu Wei is expecting you.” One of the bodyguards greets Vegas and shows him inside, through a labyrinth of corridors, an elevator, two flights of stairs and countless turns. Eventually, the bodyguard opens a heavy door before Vegas and shows him inside. 






It’s a very imposing office, and a fat man in his fifties is sitting at the desk. 






“Ah. Vegas, right?” The man says, gesturing for Vegas to approach and have a seat on the opposite side of the heavy desk. 






Vegas can immediately tell this meeting is not set to go his way. He is a guest, feeling awkward, a stranger in this man’s home, and the one asking for something. 






Luckily, he came prepared. 






“I’ve heard a lot about you from your father, only good things of course. I believe we will do good business together, you and I.” 






“That is my hope as well, sir.”"

His coffee was on the far end of the kitchen island, steaming and black, just as he liked it. 
It was a familiar sight, one that once would have filled him with quiet, steady joy, but now it made his stomach twist sourly and a sigh rise in his throat. 
All the little signs of Charlie’s kindness that littered the house tended to do that. 
Not that he thought them insincere. 
Far from it. 
Charlie and kindness were practically synonyms, at least in his mind. 
But this went so far beyond the man’s usual good grace. 
After Mick had come clean with him about the entirety of what had happened during his cancer treatments, Charlie had changed. 
Their unspoken agreement not to tell him had arisen not so much out of any amorphous desire to hide the truth from him, as to prevent him from instantly assigning blame for the entire incident, and especially Keith’s rapid downwards spiral, to himself. 
Any hope they’d had of mitigating Charlie’s guilt had died within the first handful of days. 
He steadfastly refused to bring the topic up, but Keith had caught the former artist studying him in an unguarded moment, and the self-loathing and fear which lit his eyes hurt even to look at. 
Initially, and quite naively, they’d thought it was best to just let him get it out of his system, to play along for a bit and wait until he’d assuaged his conscience enough to go back to normal. 
Waking up without him in the bed the next morning, and having every meal and snack made for them, when they normally shared that duty, should have been the first indication that it was an asinine plan. 
It had only been when Mick mentioned that they slept easier with him between them that he’d stopped sleeping in the draftiest, barely furnished guest bedroom in the place. 
They rarely saw him if he wasn’t, though he very frequently was, doing something for them. 
Whether it be fetching a blanket, giving a shoulder rub, making tea, or countless other favors, small and large. 
It was as though he melted into the walls, waiting for their beck and call and making himself scarce in the meantime, like his servitude was all they’d still want of him. 
Anything they asked for was theirs.
He no longer initiated hugs and kisses, and, while he accepted them when they were given, he was quick to give all the pleasure he could and then redirect Mick and Keith towards each other, seemingly blind to (or uncaring of) getting anything for himself. 
Two nights before, when they’d gotten distracted from preparing for bed, he’d pressed a line of kisses from the nape of Keith’s neck down his spine to the lowest part of his back, just the way he knew drove the guitarist the craziest. 
When Keith attempted to return the favor and began running his fingers teasingly over the sides of the his abdominals, Charlie had, ever so gently, pushed his hands away and placed them into Mick’s hair, murmuring in his ear about how much the vocalist loved it when he played with his hair. 
Mick had met the same response when he attempted to rub Charlie’s shoulders. 
After a month and a half of living this perpetual, slow motion nightmare, Keith was beginning to think it would never end. 
 
◑  ◐
 
They’d awoken one night, only a week or so previous, to find Charlie curled up on the floor at the foot of the bed, like he was their dog rather than their partner. 
He’d told him, perhaps too harshly, that he’d better never catch him doing it again. 
It wasn’t just his inherent disgust at the image it evoked, or the painful lack of Charlie in his arms, which provoked the response. 
With the man out of their reach for so much of every day, the time they had together at night, especially when his two other partners were asleep, was often his only opportunity to check up on him. 
Having appointed himself the duty of preparing each meal, and rising excruciatingly early to have breakfast on the table and himself out of the kitchen by the time they came down to eat, breakfast was almost always the sole meal they all shared. 
If the increasing prominence of Charlie’s ribs, and the gradual deflation of his stomach from flat to concave, was anything to go by, it was also the sole meal that the drummer was allowing himself every day. 
Without keeping an eye on him, Keith’s mind supplied, their partner would rapidly, happily waste away to nothing. 
Even with both of their eyes on him, they didn’t appear to be doing much but hastening his fate."

Once, upon a time, before he had learned of his powers, Eric had been able to live a completely normal life. He went to school, his parents dragged him to soccer practice every Tuesday, he had friends and family who loved him.

But then his mom got sick.

It had been devastating when she passed. Eric had sworn he would never allow anyone to go through the torment his mother went through ever again. He knew it was childish, but he decided that if anyone was to figure out how to cure all illness in the world, he was determined it would be him.

And, though he didn't know exactly how, his determination seemed to manifest into a reality.

When his friend got sick, just a common cold, Eric could feel it. He felt the illness festering inside his friend, and when he tried to grab onto it in his mind, he was miraculously able to pull the sickness out of his friend's body.

His friend hadn't noticed a thing, until he realised with a start that the symptoms he had been feeling a moment earlier had suddenly, inexplicably, let up. Eric never mentioned his actions, knowing his friend would just call him crazy or think he was making it up. Even Eric himself thought he must have been making it up. There’s no way he could have cured someone of their cold just by willing it to go away.

But then it happened again. 

His aunt got pneumonia. When he and his father visited her in the hospital, he grabbed onto that same feeling when it presented itself, and pulled it from her. She made a full recovery in seconds, proclaiming it to be a miracle sent from God.

This time was a little different though. He knows now that it’s because pneumonia is much harsher than a common cold, but at the time it had been confusing when he had started to feel the same symptoms she had been feeling. It was to a much lesser extent, only noticeable when he was thinking about it, but still there nonetheless.

He started trying to use this power more often. It seemed to work on just about anything. A friend had a scrape on their leg. It vanished and a barely noticeable nick appeared in the same spot on his own body. A family member had an asthma attack and didn’t have their puffer. He could feel his throat tighten up a little, but it was much more manageable than the real thing.

Eric eventually confided in his dad what was going on. He had been shocked, especially when he realised it must be true, but he accepted it. 

And then other people started finding out.

People he had never met before started asking him to cure them when he passed them on the street. Hospitals started asking if he could come in to cure a terminal case they had. He started being flown out to other countries to cure important leaders.

At first, he was happy to do it. He could finally help people! He could help prevent the suffering he had seen his mother go through all those years ago.

But it started to take its toll on him. For every ailment he cured, he incurred some of the pain. A few years down the line, he was taking prescription painkillers constantly, and it still wasn’t enough. Taking on all the world’s suffering was his ideal, but it still meant he had to suffer an enormous amount. 

He kept doing it though. 

He kept doing it, even though it hurt just to wake up, even though trying to slog through daily life was torment, even though he became a shadow of his former self as the pain overtook him.

It’s what the world needed.

He could be a hero for the world if all he had to sacrifice was himself."

Chapter one:

Thanks for the free kiss.

Branzy was a fairly young man, who was trying to get by with a few odd Jobs. He loved his city, and would never move, despite the high crime rates. The most famous criminal of them all was known as ClownPierce. Clown was a killer and a thief. Branzy was walking back to his small apartment through an alleyway. The sun had already set, and Branzy had a weird feeling about that night. Every inch of his body was yelling at him to run for his own safety. Branzy ignored his instincts and kept moving. That was until he heard talking from a building. The purple eyed man peeked his head around a corner and fear clouded his eyes. He saw a man with a clown mask talking to another man with a demon mask. Leaning against a wall nearby was a girl dressed in purple and another girl wearing a pink face mask and a darker pink outfit. He thought he recognized the pink girl but he was torn from his thoughts when he heard sirens. 

“Damn it.” Spoke the devil masked man.

“It’s fine, they haven't caught us before.” The clown masked man responded. This sentence made Branzy’s blood run cold. It confirmed his worries. This was a part of Clownpierce’s gang. That meant that the clown masked man was Clown himself and the devil masked guy was Rasplin. This meant the purple girl was Mid and the pink haired girl was the girl known as the Cello assassin. Branzy began to walk away backwards, terrified for his life. The sirens came closer and Clown laughed. He began to walk in Branzy’s direction.

“Come on guys, we’ve gotta get out of here.” Branzy panicked and took off running. He didn't care that it was likely the clown had heard him. He just heard the sirens and fear took over. He kept on running and running until he was out in the open again. Branzy felt someone begin to catch up with him and he lunged for a trash bin, hiding behind it. He heard footsteps and heard Clown chuckle to himself. 

“I love a good chase.” With that the man kept walking. Branzy rested his head against the wall and breathed a sigh of relief. He was safe. For now. Eventually he got back up and walked away. 
 
ClownPierce POV

Clownpierce was talking with his team about his newest heist plan. He heard someone walk over to them, and his eyes glanced to the side, seeing a cute white haired and purple eyed boy. Clowns head didn’t move so the boy didn't know he had seen him. He didn't seem to be a threat and so Clown just let him be. Eventually he heard the sirens and the team broke apart. Clown heard the boy run away and Clown chose to move in that direction as well. He saw the boy lunge behind a bin and try to hide. Clown chuckled.

“I love a good chase.” He continued walking away. He looped back and followed the boy as he headed back to where Clown assumed his house was. 




  Branzy POV

Branzy kept walking. He felt like someone was following him but he never saw anyone, so he just chalked it up to paranoia. Eventually Branzy began to feel this feeling every night when he went home. One day the purple eyed man had dealt with multiple Karen’s at his fast food job, and just wanted to go home and sleep. He went with the fastest, yet the most dangerous way home. As he went he heard an Alarm. A few minutes later he saw a figure run towards him. Branzy panicked and tried to back away. It turned out to be Clownpierce. The man grabbed Branzy and pinned him to the wall. He pulled off his mask and quickly clasped a hoodie around himself, tugging the hood somewhat down. Clown was easily the most attractive person Branzy had ever seen. Clowns brown/black hair fluttered behind him and his dark brown eyes stared into Branzy’s purple ones. Clown brushed some of Branzy’s white hair out of his face. They were pulled out of their trance when the police came running. Clown leaned forwards.

“Sorry about this beautiful.” Before Branzy could react, Clown kissed him. The police came running, and just saw a couple kissing. Once the police were far away they broke apart and stared into each other's eyes.

“Sorry again Mi Amor. But thanks for the free kiss.” Clown slipped his mask back on and winked before walking away. Branzy stood in the alley blushing hard. He eventually walked back to his home and Ivory, his roommate hugged Branzy tight.

“Oh branzy, i was so worried!” Ivory noticed the far away look  in his eyes.

“Are you alright?”

“Hm? Oh yeah i'm fine…” branzy walked to his room and collapsed onto his bed. 

“Mi Amor…. Thanks for the kiss…. Did the gods send me a demon?” Ivory listened from behind the door and sighed, phoning Clown.

“Clown! I told you not to flirt with my best friend!” She hissed.

“I cant help it! He’s so cute!”

“Yeah well now hes staring at the roof!”

“Tell him i already miss him.”

“No!” Ivory hung up. 

“Oh Branzy… this isn't safe for you…”"

It used to feel like a trivial thing for Edward as he had no attachment to it, not able to link it with anything but just a piece of object to push him forward to another day.It was now filled with accents of colors from the girls tendency to leave things in his room, From her beloved plushies to her loeapard print blanket, her makeup, just every knickknacks she can bring in to his life. It also was a prospect to how the younger woman had brought life and sparks of color within his dull, and washed black and white vision.Now he wouldn't be able to walk inside his room without a random stuff of her laying around, It felt oddly wrong to not see an indicator of her presence. Edward has grown accustomed to how her whole night skincare routine was scattered on his bedside table, fighting for space alongside the towers of papers from his research on the mayor and how far the rabbit hole of corruption really goes under Gotham. It felt off not to see golden strands or hair stuck on his comb, that he barely even used before, or,  the way his room smelled of strawberries from her soft perfume. Miu ran her manicured fingers to his messy mop of brown hair, his chest slowly leveling down wuth every stroke of her hands, lulling him further to the sweet embrace of sleep.Edward could put aside his world view for a moment, all the chaos and booming voices within his head dying down at her presence. She was his home, his rest. And for a moment, he let everything wash away, the orphange, Gothams rotten core, its nasty rats, and rested against her lap, melting away from her sheer warmth.The lovers locked eyes before Miu ushered him to sleep, kissing his eyelids as a bind to cast whatever spell she casted on Edward for him to feel as smitten as he was. With that, the man finally let himself be carried to dreamland, the muffled screams within his walls casting a sweet melody to his ears, dreaming nothing of her and his plans to deface the lowly rat in his basement."

L asked, his voice cool and collected. ""You and Light are both facing serious charges. It would take quite a bribe to make me overlook them.""Misa took a deep breath, steeling herself for what she was about to do.

""But if I do this, you and Light both walk free.

She pushed L down onto the bed, straddling him and running her hands over his toned body. He was already hard, and Misa could feel herself growing wet with anticipation.She leaned down and kissed him deeply, her tongue exploring every inch of his mouth. L moaned into her mouth, his hands gripping her hips tightly as she rocked against him.Their clothes fell to the floor, no foreplay needed, as Misa was already drenched with the thought of being let free. It was a mix.. that of being free, and she also wanting to get it over with.

You and Light are still under my watchful eye.""Misa nodded, knowing that she had gotten what she wanted. But as she got dressed and left the room, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She knew that L was a dangerous man, and that he would always be watching her.But for now, she was free. And that was all that mattered.As she walked down the hall, she couldn't help but think about what had just happened. She was both exhilarated and terrified at the same time. She had never felt such a powerful connection with anyone before, but she also knew that she had just given herself over to a man who was notorious for his lack of emotion.Misa couldn't ignore the nagging feeling in the back of her mind that this was just the beginning of a dangerous game.

Parrot calls out the site director's office.There's another guy there- well, two. He knows both of them. One more over the other. So there's the site's best psychiatrist, Dr. Marriot or rather just Rekrap and then there's another researcher, Dr. Greyson which is Jaron who is also known for surviving multiple breaches in containment with sheer luck.""Oh, wow, you finally came."" Jaron jokes to him.""Look, running with a cup of coffee in a hallway of slippery floors is not easy."" Parrot tells him. ""So, please, shut up, okay?""""Alright, enough."" Branzy, the site director and the man assigned to this entire facility, stands up to grab a folder from a drawer in the office.The director places the folder on the desk and the three look at eachother on who's going to open it first like some gift under the christmas three. Parrot's in the middle so he grabs it for himself and opens the file.Number #: SCP-7888, Object Class: Safe It reads out, but the code name isn't present on the file for some reason.""So, uh- Jaron, Parrot, both of you were chosen to take hold of this anomaly until further notice. Rek is here to do a psychological evaluation on the anomaly."" Branzy explains.
Description: SCP-7888 is composed of two parts. SCP-7888-A is a phone with a navy blue case and SCP-7888-B is a nineteen(19) year-old named 'Vortex' from Beacon, New York. SCP-7888-B lives in a parallel reality where all living beings do not exist with exception of him. Time seems to also be frozen in this version of reality.
""So...."" Jaron clicks his tongue. ""it's a kid's phone?""""Well, yeah, it's safe obviously."" Branzy replies. ""I don't think it's gonna explode in your face or something like that. The only reason it's in our posession is 'cause this guy is attached to this phone which is the only bridge between our reality and his. Even without the- the no people thing, it's still anomalous because we somehow have a phone of a person that does not exist in our world.""""I think years of isolation and not having a single ounce of social stuff going on is probably enough to warrant a visit to a psychologist."" Parrot remarks.The other three look at him, staring.Just staring.The watch around Branzy's wrist ticks and the director clicks his tongue.""Yeah- well, yeah, that's kind of the entire point why Rekrap is here in the first place. It's not like he can successfully study an anomaly without dying or getting injured in a way."" Branzy says.""The last time I was invited to research an anomaly, I almost died."" Rekrap adds on.""And that's why we don't put site psychiatrists in danger anymore.""Parrot's holding the file and the three are walking to the containment area for this little phone guy. Branzy gave them some stuff to remember, like, they don't need a charger for this phone and they can communicate to the anomaly(a nineteen year old that doesn't know what's happening) through his phone's notes app.There's a few things Parrot has subconsciously learned against his own will, like this Vortex guy sometimes bullying researchers if they don't play in with stuff like jokes; that his birthday is somewhere in March; and that he probably has an addiction to red bull but hey, Parrot doesn't like seeing himself commenting on other people's business.The three all get to the containment area with a plaque above the metal letting them know of it. Most euclid and safe anomalies in site-15 are contained here. From objects to a dimension-hopper who's screams are keter-class despite being classified as safe in his file.The room for this anomaly isn't all that fancy. Just a boring white room with the traditional containment locker for the object anomalies and a metal table with two chairs parallel to eachother.Parrot sets down the file onto the table before he opens up the locker to the phone. Rek takes the time to read through the catalogues of people who made it through actually speaking to this 'Vortex' person.""Alright, here's the phone."" Parrot announces to the two others in the room with him.He can't really say that he'd like this phone but it looks okay enough. It has a navy blue, plastic casing with a golden coloured border on the sides.""Does it have a password?"" Jaron asks.""Uh, yeah."" Parrot answers.""Try zero-three, twenty-four."" Rekrap says as he looks up fron the file.Surprisingly, it works. What comes next is showing the wallpaper with a bunch of other apps organized into small groups.The wallpaper is of the owner with a gecko- a lizard, some kind of reptile, Parrot is not an expert. The owner, Vortex, is holding this reptile up in the shade in a car and the first thing Parrot can point out is probably the guy's silver eyes and the slight bruise on his lips.""So, uh, where do we start then?""Just as when Parrot asks, the screen starts to move by itself. Swiping through apps, clicking, before getting to the notes application.The keyboard props up and Parrot and Jaron are really confused.'Who are you?' The writer on the other end asks them."

The duck’s family was settling slowly but surely into the new dynamics provided by the two avians. 
 
The three Caballeros were closer than ever. After helping Donald to bed that one time to alleviate the burden it became clear to all three that it was in no means a temporary arrangement. 
 
Firstly because everything became easier for him, Panchito and José taking turns with him getting up when the ducklings started crying and also because the added weight and warmth of the two eased something in him, something left gaping with grief and anger toward his sister, toward his family. 
 
Secondly because he soon learned that the other two had agreed to leave him what is now his room and they shared the cramped little office and more often than not, had to sleep on the couch. They agreed that sharing one bed was better anyway, more comfortable, saved on the heating bill… they found plenty of reasons to not stop. They would need a bigger bed at some point though. 
 
Life was good. 
 
Tonight it was Donald's turn to make dinner. Donald was quite good in the kitchen, even though his malchance acted up anytime. Louie strapped to his chest, the duck flipped pancakes over. Breakfast Dinner, boom. Perfect for stormy nights. 
 
While Huey and Dewey were fine being held or distracted by the other two Louie ,ever the fuzzy one, refused to be held by anyone other than him and so here he was, strapped to his chest in a baby sling while Huwey was making a mess of his highchair and Panchito’s t shirt, José snickering behind him Dewey sleeping on his shoulder. 
 
“Almost done, guys.” he said without turning toward the other two. 
 
José hummed positively, Panchito too busy cooing to Huey. Huey was really a difficult one when it comes to putting him to sleep or feeding him,he’s quite picky when it’s not a bottle.
 
The storm outside was getting stronger, a flash of light coming through the curtains. Unbothered, he flipped the last pancake out of the pan reaching to turn off the stove but the moment he did, the light went out. 
 
“Quê!” “ Did you turn off the light ?” came the surprised voices of the other avians. 
 
“ Sorry, guys. I think the fuse was blown out when I turned it off, it must be a short circuit.” He muttered, blindly rummaging in different drawers to look for a flashlight or even a candle. Ari had a night off, courtesy of the girls, so he had no idea where he would put it.
 
“ I don’t think it was you, pantiho.” said José from the windows, the curtains drawn back showing nothing but darkness. “ It’s the same for the whole street, probably for the whole town too.” he concluded before closing the curtain. 
 
He finally found what he thinks is a couple of glow sticks, hard to tell when it was pitch black. Tentatively bending one he waited until he heard a faint crack, followed by a green light, to pass the other sticks around. 
 
“ Would not be the first time a whole town blacked out because of me.” he snickered, handing his glow stick to José. He went back and took the plate of pancake he had left on the counter grabbing other things like syrup, butter and fruit. He came back arms full to push furniture, throwing out cushions on the ground with various buddled blanket. 
 
“What are you doing ?” he asked.
 
“Donal’ ,come sit down with us !” excitedly said the rooster, Huey in his lap. José had put down Dewey who was still sleeping soundly on a buddled blanket before Panchito put Huey down with him, both yellow ducklings turning to huddle into each other. Unstripping the baby sling, he gently set Louie down too and like his brother, turned to huddle into the other. 
 
“Lindos Patitos.” said the red rooster with a smile. 

“Eat your pancakes, Panchito.”  
 
“ I found candles and a game of cards.” 
 
- - - - - - - - - -
 
“You’re cheating !
 
“ No I’m not !
 
“ Shhh don’t wake them up “
 
“I don’t know how but you’re cheating Patito.” 
 
With a smirk the duck answered “ You can’t prove anything.” 
 
- - - - - - - - - -
 
The light was not back yet but it didn’t bother them that much. Since it was getting late, Donald took the boys back to their bed, leaving the other two to gather the cushion and comforter Panchito had gathered. When getting ready for bed a thought pops into his mind.He was still thinking about it after the other two joined him in bed.  
 
“Is it weird?”
 
“Is what weird, amigo?” whispered José half asleep.
 
“What were we doing? Sleeping in the same bed and all.”
 
“And all? You mean the cuddling or the pet names or the signs of affection?.”
 
“Hmm.” 
 
“Well. I don’t think it’s weird … Whatever it is, as long as it makes all of us happy, I don’t see why it would be weird. Maybe people outside of it would but they don’t matter. What matters to me is you two.” said Panchito.
 
Donald and José exchanged a look trying to stifle their laughter. 
 
Life was good to him."

Uchiha Sarada is brought to Konoha.",English,714,1/1,1,15,1,45,"It comes down to Sakura and Naruto and that really isn’t a choice at all. Naruto is in the village only half the time, running errands, running missions for Kakashi. The war was less than a decade ago, but besides their ever-steady alliance with Sunagakure, things are already looking worse. Konoha has the benefit of having the strongest Jinchuuriki, but Konoha has to shoulder the loss of being the cause of so much hurt. They all know it and Kakashi knows it too. When she was younger, Sakura hadn’t understood, but now, so much bloodshed later, she thinks of herself at six, thinks of her teacher, and wonders if Kakashi would have ever been given a genin team if not for the Kyuubi and the Sharingan.He’s prepping them for the worst again. Naruto isn’t anywhere near ready to become Hokage and Sakura is uncertain Kakashi isn’t willing to abolish the system altogether. Naruto is their strongest fighter and while they love him, there’s no guarantee whoever is in charge next will always love their greatest weapon.So Naruto is learning administration and all the grueling work of the anbu he should’ve been too kind for. He’s meaner nowadays, less hesitant to take a life as if he hadn’t killed at age twelve first and only kept going since.But that’s what the thought returns to: herself and Naruto. Naruto is out of the village or he’s up until 2 a.m. learning what they need to survive the next war.Sakura is doing the same, but for her, it’s taking over the hospital and the dozens of boxes full of Orochimaru’s research. She’s busy too, but she’s in the village, and Kakashi is keeping her here for a reason she can’t decipher yet. She wonders, sometimes, what her role was supposed to be, squished between Naruto and Sasuke. If they expected her to die and utilize whatever brutality inflicted on her would make greater use of her teammates.She returns to the present, to her messy apartment that is Naruto’s because he’s gone so often that keeping his own is a hassle. They can also afford a much nicer place together. Sakura hates how messy he is and how he disrupts her schedule, but she hates the loneliness more and is settled when he’s within reach. It’s only temporary for now, they both know it, but it works.And it leaves them in their predicament.Naruto doesn’t talk about his missions. In part because he’s not allowed to, in part because they’ve been taught to leave their missions at Konoha’s gate. But this mission, its result at least, returned home with him.Uchiha Sarada is preciously small and quiet in a way babies usually aren’t. Sakura doesn’t quite believe Naruto when he says that Sasuke just gave her to him, but she’s never understood what was up with them, with Sasuke and his ever-changing view of his own clan. She used to blame herself, but it’s not her failure, it never was.“I could take fewer missions,” says Naruto, says the orphan, who doesn’t know what the bare minimum is because he received so much less.“Don’t be stupid,” Sakura replies. “Even if you’re not on a mission, you’re busy and only end up knocked out on the sofa.”He has a bed but doesn’t make it there most nights.“She can’t go into the orphanage or foster care,” Naruto points out like Sakura doesn’t know that. Leaving the last Uchiha heir without adequate protection is insane. Konoha wouldn’t go to war over a single stolen infant rejected even by her parents. They know it, the other villages know it too, and after the war, everyone wants an Uchiha of their own. She wonders what that says about the Third Hokage leaving Sasuke on his own.“I can take her,” Sakura decides. She’s strong enough, she’s in the village, and she has the time for it.Naruto looks like she’s grown a second head, like he wasn’t suggesting raising Sarada himself a minute ago.“I didn’t know you ever wanted kids.”“It’s not about wanting.” It really isn’t, especially for shinobi, and Sakura has rarely gotten what she wanted.Sarada is small, however, and Sakura thinks she’ll learn to love her for it."

He’s quite happy with his ability to get good undisturbed sleep, most of which has its sweet spot between seven and a half to eight hours for optimal rest.However, even Vil is not immune to needing a trip to the bathroom, or a temperature change making him stir in his sleep. Or in the current case: a visitor. Something which is becoming increasingly less rare as the days go on. There's no creak of the door, nor the window leading to his balcony creeping open. Just a sudden  presence  where there was none before.  As undetected as said presence is trying to be, Vil still starts to sluggishly rouse from his sleep. The dim glow of something breaches through his still-closed eyelids. The sight of a rather familiar small, soft greenish light on the tip of his nose is enough to make Vil sigh, close his eyes fully again and pull his blanket over the bottom of his face. There’s a low chuckle, followed by the first rustle of someone stepping on the carpet. “Did I wake you?” The bed shifts when Vil’s nighttime intruder starts to crawl into it, shuffling closer as they worm their way under the blanket, which Vil is seemingly not content to share at the moment. “Could have done without the glowing…” Vil yawns, feeling Malleus get close enough to press his body against theirs, wrapping an arm around their waist to tug them just a little closer until Malleus’ chest meets Vil’s back.A ghost of a kiss is placed on the back of his neck as an apology, before their forehead leans into the back of his own head. “Apologies,” Malleus starts, then interrupts himself with a chuckle before he can continue, recalling an almost fond memory. “But the previous time I entered without ensuring you knew it was me, I took a blast of magic to the abdomen.” “A well-deserved one, might I add.” Vil states, his voice drowsy and slow, slightly annoyed, perhaps. “A well-deserved one.” Malleus parrots with a smile, agreeing with the statement. If anything, it’s comforting that Vil doesn’t hesitate to ensure his own safety when in a state of vulnerability such as barely waking from sleep.It’s a quality they should be proud of, thus Malleus will proudly take that spell to the gut. “Cold again?” Malleus hums a nod in response to their question. As the days grow colder, and Diasomnia itself has always been quite chilly, it’s more common for Malleus to seek out warmth for a more comfortable night. The cons of being a cold-blooded fae.Often, this was solved with a simple spell or two, something that came as easily as breathing, as Malleus loves to compare his usage of magic. But, a coincidental movie night with Vil which ended in Malleus sleeping in the Pomefiore House warden’s dorm room made him remember something very... quaint. Humans are warm creatures.  And leeching warmth from one is certainly much more fun than a plain heating spell. Once Malleus had figured that out, he hadn’t been sleeping in his own room much the past week. He isn’t sure if it’s a tad cruel that he never directly disclosed to Vil that he  could  use magic to keep himself warm instead of needing Vil for it. On the other hand, it’s been more than two years for both of them at Night Raven College, and Vil is too observant not to realize this “cold problem” couldn’t be a sudden new one and they must’ve had a way to stave it off the previous years. Malleus thinks Vil is actively acting oblivious to the situation. And isn’t that an adorable thought? “Next time, come a bit earlier… It isn’t nice to disturb me at two in the morning, I have to get up in five hours.” Vil shuffles around to get comfortable, releasing a tired sigh to rid himself of any possible tension. “It’s two-thirty, love.” “That is not helping your case.”Malleus hums a laugh and nuzzles his face into the crook of Vil’s neck to settle down, which the other makes an appreciative sound at, nudging his head against theirs momentarily before laying it back down on his pillow. A sign of affection —and something that lets Malleus know that, luckily, they don’t seem too mad or annoyed— before they return to proper sleep. ""Sleep, rosebud."" Malleus speaks in a hushed tone, placing one last kiss to the side of their neck. ""I'll make it up to you tomorrow, promise."" “Sweet dreams, schatz.”  “Sweet dreams.”"

I can’t wait any longer. I want him inside of me now.I parked his car in a dark alley.

Without a word, they began to kiss, their bodies entwining in a frenzy of passion.As they made love in the snow, Albedo noticed something strange.

His face was excited but uncertain.“Are you serious?” He questioned while Pip nodded and took off his underwear, revealing his cock. B flustered heavily and crawled over to him. After a minute of B taking off his underwear, he was ready, but saw that Pip didn’t know what to do. “Pip?

Pip giggled before he decided to tease B a bit.“Come on, Handsome! I want to try your cock out!” He complained lovingly before B laid beside him.“Go on then.” He said encouragingly, which gave him the confidence to do it. Pip cautiously put his mouth on his dick and started to suck. The moment the semen touched his tongue, he realized it actually tasted very good, and wanted more of it. So he continued to suck harder which made his lover moan a bit before he got his fill. B rolled his eyes as Pip lazily fell back in the bed, and put the covers over him. B reached over and kissed his cheek with a smile.“Goodnight, love. I’m glad you enjoyed our intimate night together.” He stated as he was about to go back to his side of the bed. Pip then grabbed his arm with a grin on his face. “Do you want to snuggle together for the rest of the night?” He asked, not really wanting this night of fun to end.

Sam looked at his brother in worry. “I told some pretty big secrets to that guy.” Dean looked around nervously.“Okay, like what?” Sam asked feeling a little worried about his brothers behaviour.“You know how I got blackout drunk and said I was in-love.” Sam nodded remembering that night, or more so remembering walking Dean towards his bed. “So I might be  and I’ve only realized it now.” Sam laughed smiling.“That’s good right.” Dean just looked out the window solemnly. “Dean who is it.” Sam asked curiosity in his voice.“It’s someone I didn’t expect.” Dean said with a small laugh. Sam looked at Dean.“So who is it.” Sam knew who he wanted it to be. The weird awkward angel Dean is always watching.“It’s Cas.” Dean said quietly getting prepared for Sam to blowup like their dad did when Dean first came out.“I knew it.” Sam said smiling widely, and laughing. Dean was shocked and confused.“What do you mean “You knew it”?” Dean asked Sam in a dangerous tone. Sam giggles at those words.“Please you’re obvious , Castiel looks at you like you hung the stars.” Sam said as he continued to list off things Cas only does for him.“Wait hold up there, I’m obvious but what about Cas. Do you think he knew.” Dean said worryingly, if he knew what would he think of Dean.“Nah he’s worse than you, I think he thinks that you’re just always horny.” Dean swatted Sam’s arm again and just laughed.“I was worried for no reason huh?” He asked himself before looking at Sam and seeing him nodding his head. “Whatever man.” Though none of theWinchesters noticed an invisible happy Castiel in the back of the car. “I love you too Dean.” He whispered quietly."

""Hey, wait up Y/n!"" a voice said, saddened. ""Do you really have to go away? I mean, it's cold up there!""
""I know, but it's because my mom got a dumb job up in New York. But let's stay in contact, yeah?"" Y/n said with a comforting smile spreading on his face.

As Y/n's friend, Mark, hugged him, Y/n couldn't help but hug back. ""I promise I'll contact you every morning, advisory, evening, and fill you in on tea."" Mark promised.
'Bullshit' Y/n thought as he stared through the backseat window of his mother's SUV, remembering that moment. ""Remind me why you got a job in New York, again?"" he asked his mother, though irritated.""Well, cuz it's a better pay than that crummy joint off the corner,"" his mom responded, using a happy and sickeningly soft voice. 'No need to act like I didn't know you worked at the drug store' Y/n stated mentally.""Come on Y/d/n, this'll be a good change from being anti-social!"" His dad suggested ""besides, you can finally make some friends"" ""Yeah, maybe even find a boy"" his mom teased ""Mom!

Y/n panickedIt was true, Y/n wouldn't have time to hang out with a guy his age, but if his mom got one thing right, it's that he does like guys. But if it wasn't for him being ripped away from his home life, he would've been fine with the idea of 'finding a boy'.He checked his phone for any new texts or missed calls. 'Of course he wouldn't send anything' he thought. 'People truly suck.'A few hours fly by like minutes. ""Why didn't we just fly to New York?"" Y/n complained. ""Because it's cheaper"" his dad stated, but Y/n didn't believe it.""We're here!"" His mom exclaimed as they pulled up to an apartment in New York. Y/n got out and took in the surroundings. It was currently 10 o'clock at night, so it was ""dark."" But in reality, the New York lights lit up the streets like it was day time.""Now go get ready for bed, Y/d/n.

In fact, she only really knew Jeff, Bob, Snare, and El Goblino, due to them all coming from the same place, Jeff also being Dupe's cousin. It did know of three interesting entities. The first one, being named Rush. He was very fast and very loud. He was quite annoying to Dupe, but his sister not as much. Rush's sister, Ambush, had caught Dupe's eyes. She admired her, despite being loud and annoying like her brother, Ambush was actually successful in killing intruders quite frequently. When not on the job, Ambush knew how to calm down, unlike her obnoxious brother. It's likely due to maturity difference, but Dupe didn't like Rush regardless. The third entity was Rush's best friend, and also equally annoying, Screech. Dupe didn't interact with Screech much, due to it just being there, while Screech was actively biting players, and when off duty Screech would be hanging out with Rush or his fathers, which Dupe hadn't seen much of. She'd only been there for 3 weeks, so hopefully she'll meet them soon. It knew that the ""Guiding Light"" fellow planned on hosting a meeting to properly introduce the 5 new entities once the heightened flow of trespassers calmed down, so their shifts would be shorter, leaving more time to interact properly. The feline-adjacent entity was hiding behind her door as usual, just hanging out, really, due to shift being over, when it heard a knock. It hesitated slightly, before opening her door. To it's surprise, it was Ambush. She stands up a little more properly, due to the sudden presence of someone it actually respected. The entity in front of it then began speaking, ""Hello. Um.. Dupe, yes?"" She seemed quite socially awkward, which made Dupe loosen up a bit, knowing she didn't have to be on high alert near her. ""Yes, Dupe. Your name is Ambush, correct?"" It asks, making sure she's correct. ""Yes, I'm Ambush... Um. I'm here to show you around a little.. if you wish."" The shorter entity spoke again. Dupe perks up at the chance to actually get familiar, and agrees to it, swiftly making her way through it's door. Ambush takes Dupe's claw, as to guide it, but the sudden touch makes her flustered, with Dupe already crushing, but Ambush couldn't like it back, right? It barely knows them, plus, she's it's coworker for fucks sake! Dupe has to stay strictly professional! Little did she know, not only was Ambush feeling the exact same, but she'd done it on purpose. However, if she needed an excuse, ""to guide"" always works. Making sure the taller entity doesn't get left behind. As Ambush was touring the hotel for Dupe, she was surprised that they hadn't run into any other entities yet. I wonder what's happening.Rush knew exactly what Ambush was doing. He'd planned so she'd go and see Dupe, show it around the hotel, and they'd fall in love. And why would Rush do this? Because his sister was a useless lesbian who had nobody to be useless with. He was a good brother deep down, so he made sure that no other entities would interrupt the two, by of course, all gathering in one room for the entirety of their time together, as to not disturb the idiotic gays at work. All the other entities, huddled up at door 100, was not a good idea. Everyone was doing their own things, with Seek attempting to help Figure calm down from all the noise in one corner, Eyes and Halt doing whatever the fuck they do in another, Jack and Hide occupying a closet together, Screech annoying everyone, but for the most part everyone was minding their own business, likely annoyed because of the shitty situation. But anything for love, I guess.As the duo reached the Courtyard, they couldn't help but stop and admire it. ""Jack really does a good job taking care of the plants out here, hm?"" Ambush mumbles to herself. ""Jack does all of this?"" Dupe questions, not knowing much about the entity, but not expecting him to be the gardening type. ""Yeah. He's talented."" She speaks, her voice smooth as ice. Dupe admired Ambush's voice, alongside the life of the Courtyard. ""Your voice is really cute, you know."" Dupe mutters, hoping Ambush didn't hear her. Dupe looks up to see Ambush's ""face"" flushed. 'Oh god,' it thought. 'Why did I say that? She wouldn't like me! I'm just-' before getting cut off by Ambush, ""Thank.. you."" She said, obviously flustered. ""N.. no problem."" Dupe replied. They just stood there, staring at god knows what, before Ambush spoke again. ""Well... We should get going, hm?"" Dupe nodded, and the duo took hands and made their way back to Dupe's door.Finally, after traversing the many many doors, they'd reached their destination. ""This was... fun, I'll see you around?"" Dupe said. Ambush nodded, before speaking, ""Of course, I also thought this was.. enjoyable."" Before pulling Dupe in for a small kiss on the cheek. ""Toodles!"" Ambush teased while walking off, leaving Dupe flustered. 'That was.. woah.' Dupe thought.  PLS GIVE FEEDBACK I DONT WRITE SHIT LIKE THIS OFTEN 😭😭😭 -🚪"

Saskia woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't go back to sleep, after a few failed attempts she got off her bed and headed outside for some fresh air, she didn't expect to see Genevieve also awake and smoking a cigarette by the balustrade.""Those are bad for you, you know.""Genevieve was so startled she dropped the cigarette. ""For fuck’s sake! Are you trying to kill me?!""""Sorry."" Saskia grabbed the cigarette from the floor and gave it back to Genevieve. ""You really shouldn't smoke these.""""It’s not like you to care Saskia.""  Genevieve looked at Saskia sincerely confused that the brunette was even talking to her.""Still, I don't want to loose more women than we already have.""""Oh, that makes more sense, I’m just another body in the Saskia survival army, right?"" Genevieve immediately regretted her choice of words, she could see how hurt and disheartened Saskia actually looked.""Genevieve, can we not do this right now, can't we just have a normal conversation, for once.""""I’m sorry. I guess I’m too wired up. Yesterday was… fucked up."" Genevieve finally admitted, they were both exhausted and there was no point in fighting anymore.""Yeah… I couldn't sleep.""""You’ve never killed or butchered anyone before? I would have thought it to be mandatory to join your little cool girls gang. I’m shocked.""""Genevieve!"" Saskia was about to go off on Genevieve but when she actually looked at the taller woman she saw her smile and the twinke in her eyes, she was just joking, she just wasn't used to seeing this side of Genevieve. ""We weren't a gang, nor did we murder or butcher anyone.""""Not literally. So what would I have to do to join your little TC gang?""""Again, not a gang! But you’re halfway there, cigarettes, breaking curfew, leaving the school in the middle of the night.""""Halfway?! What would I have to do to be fully in?""""Well, you need booze and make out with someone in the fingering bench.""""Booze? You mean like this?"" Genevieve asked while showing the whisky bottle she was hiding behind her back.""How drunk are you already?""""Not drunk enough to make out with you.""""Are you saying you would have to be drunk to make out with me? Do you find me that repulsive?""""You know very well that your looks isn't what I find repulsive.""""So you do find me attractive?""""I might wear glasses but I’m not blind.""Suddenly the mood shifted, Saskia grabbed the bottle from Genevieve's hands and took a long sip.""So, how bad do you want to join the cool girls gang tonight?""Genevieve was actually speechless for a moment, she needed to be sure Saskia meant what she was saying, ""I thought it wasn't a gang?""""Do you want in or not?""Genevieve didn't wait for an answer, she grabbed a hold of Saskia’s shirt and pulled her towards her, kissing her intensely. In a matter of seconds the cigarette and the booze were forgotten. Genevieve’s hands were otherwise busy fucking Saskia against the balustrade.This was something Genevieve was exceptionally skilled at and she would show Saskia just how good she was. Her hands and mouth were everywhere, there wasn't an inch of Saskia’s body Genevieve hadn't touched.Saskia’s first orgasm came quickly, surprising both women and afterwards Genevieve took her time, she knew she would never get to do this again and decided to enjoy it. She found out that Saskia’s breasts were very sensitive and she would shiver whenever she licked the tips with her tongue, she also found out Saskia was ticklish around her hips and she would catch her breathe whenever Genevieve would brush her fingers against it.In the end Saskia came three more times with Genevieve’s fingers between her legs and she could barely catch her breath.Genevieve let her recover in her arms, against her chest.""Are you okay?""""Yeah, that was… good.""""Good? I just gave you four orgasms, how many of your lovers can say that?""""Uh… not many.""When Saskia had her strength back Genevieve took a step away from the brunette and grabbed the whisky bottle on the floor, she took a quick sip before turning back to Saskia.""It’s late, I’m going back to my room and try to get some sleep.""""What? But don’t you want me to… return the favor."" Saskia was shocked and a little bit pissed that Genevieve was just walking away.""I’m fine. Good night Saskia""And for the first time in forever Saskia was lost for words."

It was a hot summer day in Verona, and Tybalt was in a bad mood. He had been out practicing his swordsmanship all morning, but nothing seemed to go right. He had lost his focus, and his movements were sloppy. He sheathed his sword in frustration and sat down on a nearby bench, staring at the ground.""Hey, Tybalt! What's got you so down?"" Mercutio said as he approached Tybalt.""Nothing,"" Tybalt grumbled, not looking up.""Come on, Tybalt, don't be like that. Tell me what's wrong,"" Mercutio persisted.""It's just...I don't know. I can't seem to get anything right today,"" Tybalt admitted.""Ah, I see. Well, how about a friendly spar?

""You know me better than that.""The two drew their swords and began their dance. Tybalt felt himself relax as his body remembered the familiar movements. He began to focus, and his movements became fluid and precise.Mercutio was a worthy opponent, and the two of them fought fiercely. But as they danced, Tybalt noticed something different about Mercutio. His movements were more playful, less aggressive than usual. There was a lightness in his step that Tybalt had never seen before.Tybalt felt a sudden surge of emotion he couldn't quite name. He had never thought of Mercutio in that way before, but as he watched him move, he couldn't help but feel drawn to him.The spar came to an end as they both lowered their swords, breathing heavily.

Emotions she had not felt for centuries bubble under the surface the longer she stares. Whispers of Hatred and Darkness echo throughout her mind as she falls deeper and deeper into her mind.“A corpse should be left alone.” Her words startle her companion, Zavala, who gazed at her for a short time before returning his gaze to the sheet. “Why do you say that?”, he asks her, his eyes filled with confusion as she pats him on the shoulder. “I say this from experience Zavala. A corpse, should it be disturbed, will never find rest even after the reason of its disturbance is dead.” Her response is cold, detached from her usual motherly tone of voice that seemed to warm the hearts of many.A feeling of dread fills Zavala upon hearing these words, what had this woman seen in her time as a Risen? “Why tell me this, Zeta?”, his question echoes out in the small area they stand. Her response is something that chills him to his bones, no, beyond his physical body and into his soul.“Because I am a corpse that should have been left alone Zavala. The Witness whispers to me even now to rip and tear through all of you and become a Disciple. But I will not let myself fall to the Darkness, not after what happened the first time I Fell. I slaughtered my way through countless Guardians to get to the one that made me Fall. I made the Fall and have yet to Rise as was ordained by The Witness, Zavala.” She sighs before turning away from the the sheet and Zavala, walking towards where her ship is waiting.She calls out over her shoulder to Zavala as one last word to him as a Risen much, much older than him. “Do not let Rage cloud your thoughts Zavala, the City needs you in this trying time. I am merely an old Exo that has been alive for too long, I can allow myself to Fall as much as is needed. Let me deal with the child’s killers Zavala. You must grieve after all, grief is a good thing to have as it means you are healing from Tragedy.”The sound of her transmatting onto her ship echoes through The Farm, the sound of her ship leaving sounds out shortly after. Letting Zavala know he is now alone to his grief."

And there would be Felicity who went to the same foster family because, e.g. donna blamed her for her husband leaving or something like that, we'll see. Well then Tim, Genny and Felicity would be siblings.

B.R.A.I.N read over the instructions one last time. This had to be perfect. It looked down at the doll in his claws, It was a perfect copy of a stitchpunk. It had been difficult to put together due to its much smaller size compared to B.R.A.I.N. There had been several failed attempts but finally it was ready. Or ready enough. The small doll’s optics were not the same as his real counterpart. They could not close. Forever stuck wide and in a hexagonal shape. B.R.A.I.N just hoped that the stitchpunks were to stupid to notice. They probably were.
There was one last detail B.R.A.I.N wanted to add. It got out a red fabric. One that had once been a blanket. It had been burned. Results of the stitchpunks attack on its factory. The blanket had once belonged to the scientist that created B.R.A.I.N and the stitchpunks. B.R.A.I.N started to cut the blanket into a smaller shape then sewed it onto the doll. It copied the cape 1 had worn so proudly perfectly. It was missing the jewel but that didn’t matter. It was a small detail that would certainly go unnoticed.
It was ready. B.R.A.I.N zapped it and put it down, waiting for its creation to come to life. After a few moments the doll moved. It sitting up and staring at it’s creator. It’s wide eyes alone made him feel much younger than who it was based on. Then it did something that surprised it’s creator. It smiled. None of B.R.A.I.N other creations had even acknowledged it. They just instantly set off to do their job. B.R.A.I.N had expected this latest creation to act differently of course. It was created to mimic the first stitchpunk but B.R.A.I.N had expected it to run off like the rest. Slowly B.R.A.I.N sent a claw down to the fake stitchpunk and gently patted it. Creating copies of the stitchpunks was going to be… interesting."

Ricks head perked up at the sound of the front door shutting down the hall of the home, the pitter patter of Carls footsteps running up the stairs after greeting rick with a quick, ""Hi dad!"" as he ran off to his bedroom, most likely to get started on his homework. Negan soon appeared around the corner, stretching his arms into the air with a drawn out, over dramatic groan followed by a sigh as he approached Rick, wrapping his arms around his husband's waist, nuzzling his nose into the crook of where Ricks shoulder and neck connected. One of the things Rick had loved most about Negan was his overpowerful spirit and how dramatic and bouncy he could be even with the dullest of situations, one of the many things that had made the Officer fall head over heels for the man who now held onto him.Negan took a deep inhale of Ricks soft skin and sighed against it, pressing a gentle kiss to his neck as he spoke, ""You smell good,"" he murmured gently, earning a warm smile from rick who hummed in response, placing the lid over the pot he was just stirring not too long ago, ""Hello to you too,"" he greeted in amusement, leaning back against Negan's chest with a soft sigh, letting his eyes fall closed in a sense of comfort in the man's grasp that tightened slightly around his waist.""Did ya just shower?""
""I did, after I got off my shift an hour or so ago,"" Rick responded turning his head to the left to press a gentle kiss to Negan's cheek,
""you buy new body wash?"" Negan pestered, opening up his eyes to lazily gaze up at Rick through his eyelids, giving a squished smile from where his face was pressed into Ricks shoulder who chuckled and brought a hand up to cup the side of Negan's face ""you went shopping with me, shouldn't you know?"" he asked, gently rubbing his thumb affectionately across the salt and pepper stubble along Negan's jaw.
Negan scrunched his nose and stood up straight behind rick now, peering over the top of ricks head at the stove ""right as rain! and it smells lovely, but, y'know what smells even better?"" He asked, resting his chin atop ricks head who gave a huff and crossed his arms, ""Negan,"" he started in a warning tone, ""I know spaghetti is your favorite but don't you dar-,"" Rick began, but was soon cut off by Negan letting go and reaching past rick to lift the lid off the pot on the stove, gently waving it to waft the steamy smell of the cooking pasta into the air as he took a large inhale, a sly grin spreading across his face as he sighed heavily, chest dropping as he did, sinking against the counter, ""spaghetti!"" he announced, proud of himself while Rick watched, turning his head away to hide the smile he couldn't force himself to hold back,
""Ah!""

""And you're hiding it from me?"" Negan teased in a half whine, reaching forward to grab hold of his husbands' shoulders who fought back and refused to look at Negan stubbornly, trying to keep his lips pressed in a straight line but he couldn't help the corners of his mouth fighting back in a downturned smile, ""Riiiick~"" Negan cooed in a sing song tone, reaching one hand up to take hold of ricks chin between his thumb and index finger, ""Come on baby, look at me with that pretty smile of yours,"" he coaxed, rick turning the direction Negan led him and smiled at him, ""You are terrible."" RIck told him through laughter, pulling out of Negan's grasp, ""And you smell like Sweat and rubber from being at the School all day,"" Rick stated, poking Negan in the chest who just stared down at Rick with the most adoring smile as he listened to every word Rick said, ""you are so nice to me"" Negan said sarcastically, leaning down enough to place his hand on the small of ricks back pulling rick forward into a sweet, delicate kiss that Rick returned, breaking it to press a kiss to Negans nose, ""go shower"" he told him, earning a salute and a ""Yes sir,"" from Negan who snuck another kiss to ricks forehead, ""I love you""

She wouldn’t let things go unpunished.Or, Pepa purposely cockblocks Julieta and Agustín to annoy them.",English,781,1/1,,5,1,29,"After a long day of work and chores, they were tired. Tired and pent up, having retreated to their room for the night after dinner. Ready to rest and relax, and of course, have each other before bed. No day would be complete without a quick de-stressing session of intimacy, after all. Not when they were so pent up, having given each other needy bedroom eyes all day, truly longer for the moment when they would be alone and behind closed doors.
 
But as much as they wanted to have each other, it seemed that fate had other plans. Because as they tried to initiate things, everything slowly heated up as the excitement built up between them, fate had decided that it was a hilarious idea to let Pepa annoy them today.
 
Over and over, as Julieta quickly found a growing resentment for her sister inside of her. Because it was clear from the way she acted and her expression that she was doing this specifically to annoy them and to disturb them, all for her own joy of messing with them. It was vile, and in Julieta’s current pent up state, it was unforgivable.
 
Pepa was preventing her from getting something she needed, and she swore that if she continued, that she would get her revenge. She wouldn’t let things go unpunished. Because out of all the days that Pepa could decide to annoy them, why would it have to be 

today 

when Julieta wanted to 

throw 

herself at Agustín?”
 
It started while things were just getting good. The two of them sealed in a fierce kiss, hands running over each other’s bodies. Agustín’s shirt had been thrown aside, and in the middle of their needy kisses, Agustín had been about to pull Julieta’s skirt down.
 
Then Pepa had arrived, slamming the door open as loud as she could and simply waltzed in, causing them to freeze up in startled confusion as she walked into their room towards her vanity. All to annoy them. They knew.




“Don’t mind me. I’m just borrowing Julieta’s hairbrush.”
 
She got it and left.
 
Julieta and Agustín stare at each other for a moment and then groan in frustration. Now the moment was partially ruined, and they would have to start all over to build things up.
 
They do, as they continue to kiss each other roughly, and Julieta’s skirt is indeed thrown aside. A few minutes of kissing, touching and petting pass, and just as things are about to get good again with her trying to remove Agustín’s pants, Pepa interrupts 

again, 

slamming the door open once more as they are startled.
 

Why?

 
Couldn’t a pent up married woman try to have sex in peace?
 
“I’m just returning the hairbrush. Don’t mind me.”
 
Julieta swore that she had never hated her sister as much as she did this very moment. This was incredibly cruel.
 
Pepa leaves once more, causing Julieta to groan as she grasps at the sheets, the nice buildup gone once more. Was having sex with her husband before bed too much to ask for in this household?
 
She knew Pepa was doing it to disturb them and to annoy them. And it made her feel spite. She gritted her teeth in annoyance.
 
Once more, she begins to kiss Agustín, refusing to give up. She wasn’t going to let Pepa win this fight. But after just two more minutes of kissing, she hadn’t even managed to remove his pants yet. And just as she was about to do so, Pepa burst in for a third time.
 
“Now I need to borrow your lipstick.”
 
Julieta felt her blood boil.
 
Pepa was going to pay. And she was going to make sure to finally have a lock installed to her room. That would keep her out for good.
 
If she did this once more… then… then Julieta would lose it completely. She couldn’t take this anymore. Not when she needed Agustín so badly.
 
She leaves once more, and 

finally 

Julieta continues to kiss Agustín. Their hands run over each other, and this time they do have time to remove his pants. And her bloomers. She feels the excitement of 

finally 

being able to have him, just a little more. Soon all of her pent up needs would be gone, and she would get what she desired. Oh, how she craved him.
 
Then 

she 

bursts into the room for a fourth time.
 
A fourth 

fucking time. 

Interrupting them once more, as Agustín quickly pulls the covers over them since they’re now nude.
 
“Now I need your hairbrush again.”
 
Julieta had enough.


“Pepa, you are dying in your sleep tonight. 

Let me have sex in peace!”"

Obi-Wan had managed to gain the upper hand, but as he looked down at the battered, broken body of his once-beloved Padawan, he felt no sense of triumph.Instead, he felt a deep sense of sadness and regret. He had failed Anakin, had failed to prevent him from falling to the dark side and becoming the Sith Lord, Darth Vader. And now, he was faced with the impossible task of killing the man he had once loved like a son.Obi-Wan ignited his lightsaber and slowly made his way down the slope towards Vader. The sound of his footsteps echoed in the silence, each one a heavy weight on his heart.As he approached, Vader struggled to rise, his mechanical limbs whirring and clicking. ""You underestimate my power,"" he rasped, his voice strained.Obi-Wan didn't respond. He knew that this fight was already over, that there was no hope left for his former apprentice. He raised his lightsaber, ready to strike the final blow.But as he looked into Vader's glowing eyes, he saw something that gave him pause. He saw the pain and anguish that Vader was feeling, the regret and sorrow for all that he had lost. And in that moment, Obi-Wan knew that he couldn't do it. He couldn't kill his former apprentice, not when he saw the humanity still left in him.Instead, Obi-Wan deactivated his lightsaber and stepped back. ""I can't do it, Anakin,"" he said softly. ""I can't kill you.""Vader looked up at him, his eyes filled with confusion and despair. ""Then what will you do?"" he asked.Obi-Wan shook his head. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""But I can't let you continue down this path of darkness. You have to stop, Anakin. You have to find a way back to the light.""Vader struggled to his feet, his breath ragged. ""It's too late for me,"" he said, his voice barely a whisper. ""I'm too far gone.""Obi-Wan reached out a hand, wanting to comfort his former apprentice, but he knew that it was too late. Vader stumbled backwards, his body wracked with pain and sorrow.And then, with a final anguished cry, Vader fell backwards into the lava pit. Obi-Wan watched in horror as the flames consumed his former apprentice, tears streaming down his face.He had failed Anakin again, had failed to save him from the darkness. And as he stood there, alone in the silence, Obi-Wan knew that he would carry that failure with him for the rest of his life."

Attracts too much attention.”Jeonghan looks around and notices they aren’t the only ones watching but everyone was focused on the players so he doesn’t think anyone would mind if he watches a show on his phone.He was brought out of his thoughts when he hears a shout.“Watch out!” Jeonghan’s eyes widen as he sees the captain lose his balance from getting hit by his teammate, and both him and the ball are going to crash into him.Jeonghan closes his eyes as he feels the bench fall back, bracing for impact. He opens his eyes as he feels a strong arm catch him, pulling him up even as the bench clatters to the floor.He finds himself face to face with Choi Seungcheol, the other man above him, bracing himself with his left hand while the other cradled Jeonghan.“Are you okay?” Seungcheol asks, sighing in relief as Jeonghan nods. He stood up, brining Jeonghan to his feet at the same time. He watches Jeonghan brush himself off, before fixing the bench and getting the ball.“I’m really sorry.” Seungcheol says before walking towards his team, who were all standing nervously to the side.“50 laps!” They started running even before Seungcheol finished what he was saying.“Are you sure you’re alright?” Jisoo asks as he sits beside Jeonghan, watching the other watch Seungcheol. “I think you hit your head because you’re staring right now.”Jeonghan fights down a blush before waving Jisoo closer. “I think he hurt his hand earlier.”“Oh please you just want to ogle at him.” He replies before turning to watch Seungcheol as well. They both saw him wince and shake off his hand before pressing a towel onto it.“I’ll go tell someone.” Jeonghan stands up and walks towards the coach, who was watching from the side.“Hey kid, you good? Want me to have them run more laps?”Jeonghan laughs as he shakes his head. “Oh no, but I was actually wondering if you can call the captain? I think he hurt his hand from earlier.”They both watch as Seungcheol removes the towel, a bit of red showing.“Choi! Come here.” As Seungcheol runs towards them, the coach adds, “Follow Mr. Yoon to the clinic.”With wide eyes, Seungcheol looked like he was about to protest. Whatever he had to say died in his throat as his coach just pointed to the door.-“Ow.”Jeonghan laughed as he watched Seungcheol turn away from his wound, wincing every now and again even though Jeonghan hadn’t done anything yet.“Oh hush, I haven’t even started.”As Jeonghan gently cleaned his wounds, Seungcheol couldn’t help but stare. Blond wisps framing his face, the look of concentration in his eyes. Seungcheol had never seen someone quite as beautiful.“Done.” Jeonghan says, shaking him from his thoughts as he sealed the end of the bandage. “Make sure to clean it every day with mild soap and water to prevent infections.”Jeonghan places a roll of bandages in his other hand for him to take home, along with a lollipop.“For being a good patient.” Jeonghan says with a wink.Seungcheol laughs, before unwrapping and putting it in his mouth. When he doesn’t do anything else, Jeonghan turns around and faces him again.“Need anything else?”Seungcheol pouts, “You didn’t kiss it better.” He jokingly says, wondering where he got to guts to say such a thing.When Jeonghan doesn’t immediately respond, he waves his wounded hand with an awkward laugh.“I was just joking-“ he cute himself off when Jeonghan grabs his hand.“There.” Jeonghan says as he places a soft kiss above the bandages. “Better?”“Ye-yeah.” Seungcheol winces as his voice squeaks a little. He clears his throat. “Yes, much better.”If Seungcheol had anything else to say, Jeonghan wasn’t able to hear it as the doors to the clinic open and the rest of the basketball team shuffled in. Apologizing to Jeonghan while joking with Seungcheol.‘Next time.’ Seungcheol thought to himself as he watched Jeonghan smile and joke with his friends, ‘Next time I’ll ask you out.’"

“Uh… I’m good… I have something to tell you, both,” he said fidgeting with his jumper sleeve. He awkwardly sat down in the chair across from him. Both of them were waiting patiently for him to speak. 
 
Harry took a deep breath before speaking. “I’m Pansexual.”
 
“Holy shit!” Sirius yells. Remus cups his hand over Sirius’ mouth.
 
“What?” Harry whispered under his breath. Remus heard what he said and elaborated.
 
“Harry your father was Pansexual. Same with your grandfather, Fleamont, and your great-grandfather Henry. And the goes same for his father. In fact, we would have been more surprised if you ended up being straight.”
 
“I– all of them?”
 
“As far as we can tell,” Sirius said.
 
“Plus we were the first people James came out to. In fact, he dated Sirius’ younger brother,” Remus said nudging Sirius in the side with a small smirk.

He’s had a few names. Sans, Brother, Old Friend, Dust, Death, MONSTER…Some of those names had aged on him; he was no longer Sans since he lost himself and he was not anyone’s Brother after he killed Papyrus for the last time. There’s a place and a time for other names- names that bring out something powerful and greedy in him but he’s been good at limiting those names from being spoken. Considering he’s damned near invisible to the rest of the gaggle of skeletons he’s say he’s done a good job. When the newcomer knocks on the door he’s just conveniently in the kitchen waiting on the beep of the coffee maker and picking at a plate of lasagna. Two knocks in and he already heard Blue shotgunning to the door. He didn’t care to pay attention until he noticed the voice didn't sound familiar and he peered over the corner for a peep. He thought it would be the house’s lover, Babi, or even the certain pair of skeletons who were allowed to do their secret jobs and come at any weird hour of the day. Instead there was a beaming human turned sideways to shake the rain off her frog themed umbrella while happily chatting with Blue and classic Sans. Her fashion sense definitely didn't… match her age, loose green (frog??) short sleeve hoodie and baggy brown long sleeve shirt that covered the arms where the hoodie couldn't. A light skirt reached just above her knees, and cutesy rain boots shucked and kicked gently to the side. There even looked to be some pins in her hair but he was too far to be able to tell what they were.Words flowed past him, like a ball floating above a current of air that wont let it touch the ground. Even if he wanted to know what they were saying, her voice, he was so entirely distracted by his hazy idea of this person he couldn't stop staring at the way the pads of her fingers fiddled with the bright bandaids on his knuckles. Something snapped in him, and he reeled back into reality. It was the feeling of eyes on him and the white noise he didn’t realize before was abruptly gone, yet the silence was so loud. The frog girl stands in his vision with a gentle expression and a tilt that brings her closer to his height. It’s such a subtle act, it makes his SOUL feel like fire.”Hi,” she laughed with a hint of coyness and in the same breath she mentions her name. Her name rang inside his skull. Her name. Her name. Save it. She still stood in front of him, hand between him and her, a little too low to be confident, but in one second her smile had a new quirk to it. Shy fangs peeked from her soft lips. “I don’t mean to make you too nervous, I thought we should properly meet before I took too long and ruined my first impression.”  He took her warm- warm hand and internally shuddered at the contact. “It’s nice to meet you Dust, I hope we get to be good friends while I’m here.”"

Have you considered dating him?""I get asked this a lot...and what's weird is that it's usually about me and Tavros and not about any of my other fronds. I guess it's because I hang out with him the most outside of my morrail? Do we look that good together? Compatible aspects? Who knows?The point is I do love Tavros, probably more than I loved my last actual boyfrond but...I don't reelly have any desire to go out with him. Not now and probably not in the future.Why? Pretty invasive but okay: I think Tavros is tough, tougher than most people give him credit for. The thing is, tough or not, he's pretty passive when it comes to his relationships. It's never even a matter of putting his foot down on a subject, it's a matter of him letting others walk over him in a sort of preventive measure against conflict. I don't mind being friends with someone like that as long as they have compassion, which Tavros has plenty of, but when I get a partner, I need someone I can view as an equal. That means someone who can challenge me and actually stand against me when I bring up a contentious point. Tavros and I are close enough that we can argue about minor stuff but I think he folds too quickly for the major stuff and I think being in a romantic relationship would worsen that dynamic, not help it. Make no mistake, Tavros is one of the most important people in my life...but I want to make sure he stays that bay without destroying our whole teamwork with ""kissing stuff"", as the academics put it.Plus, I already kiss him so just officiating it would make it complicated.I would totally have made him my morrail but that position is taken. Otherwise, my main non-romantic squeeze is Tavros and that's the bay it will stay!"

Faust doesn't have time for such a trivial thing.""""Worry about it later.""And so, Ryoushuu glides her feet backwards and pulls Faust right into her, the latter falling into her chest as the former slipped her hand on the latter's waist.""Don't get handsy.""The artist started slow so the so-called genius could follow her steps, starting with a step to the right followed by the other foot stepping forward, creating a steady circular motion between the two dancers.A slow but romantic waltz. Its a little quiet though, don't you think?""I find it too quiet, miss Ryoushuu.""Right, the music got busted by the water (and thank goodness the sprinkler is done spewing out water), so they'll have to improvise with the music using something else.

Ryoushuu's lips were about as close as it could get to her cheek, and then she started humming to her ear.An acapella. Faust didn't even realize how beautiful her voice sounded, as the only things she would often hear from her are trivial acronyms and whatever else she decides to say. But oh, make no mistake, she sounds angelic. Whether it's her natural voice or her trying to sound pleasant, it's undeniable that it's beautiful.She's like a lullaby.Faust loosened herself up, allowing the tension to ease and her shoulders to relax, only minding the steps Ryoushuu takes next and when she should follow. Soon enough, she found herself leaning into Ryoushuu, embracing her.The artist snuck a smooch onto her cheek, making Faust even more flustered. But of course, being the person she is, she didn't say anything and insisted on keeping her smartassy poker-face on.Ryoushuu parted from their dear embrace, then trailed her index up to Faust's chin, tilting her head to face her.Their faces inch closer and closer, leaning in for a–""Ryo, Faust~ Verg is fumi–""Rodion appeared at the door, interrupting the scene they were having and breaking the immersion completely. Suddenly, Faust broke away from Ryoushuu's grasp and bolted towards the door, trying to mask as much embarrassment showing on her face as she could.""You could've knocked before entering, Rodya.""""Sorry to interrupt your little moment~ But I'd rather not get killed by Vergie.""Well, whatever.Maybe next time."

Ten people woke up, all alone in one room, a big cafeteria, it seemed. They exchanged looks, yet no words were spoken. Silence hung in the air as though the death of a loved one was just announced. 
A girl in a red suit yelled ""Where the hell am I?!""To which a white-suited person responded with ""shh! Don't yell, it won't get us anywhere. Who are all of you?""""Are names really necessary? No!"" Black barked.White shushed her as well. ""Please, let's just calm down.

Cyan
""That was really rude Red,” 
Lime
""I agree, we have to work together if we want to get out, that wasn't wor-""
A voice rang from above, like an intercom of some sort. Welcome to spaceship H3AT20, better known as The Skeld. You ten were chosen by no mistake, each of you passed your tests and proved worthy of this great opportunity. Do not take this with a grain of salt. This is something you may never have the chance to experience again. You can find tablets on the top right table of the cafeteria, they will show you your tasks along with a map. Tomorrow there will be two Imposters among you, do not be quick to trust. Crewmates, you have three jobs: fix sabotages, complete tasks, and most importantly, don't get killed.

Although they rarely realized it and made him realize it. Everything about him was an unshakable part of life. People were used to catching his name in conversation, the tip of the tongue clicking on the teeth, jumping up like a spring, hanging in the air and then dropping down, just like sending a piece of raw fish into their mouth. And those four syllables—occasionally with an addition—were just delivered briskly and fluently by their vocal cords. But the name seldom stayed long, and seldom carried emotions stronger than a dish of saury sashimi. Certainly, the speaker would not agree that it was because they did not love him, but one fact had already been proved long ago: whenever you turned around, looked away, left and returned, he was always there. Yet they didn't believe that he was special, nor did they believe that all the miracles he'd performed were due to his genius. He just did something, lived, came in and out of a certain corner of the world, and built bonds with others by chance. But for no reason at all he became 
stable
, and when they thought of the word they felt like they were describing a bridge. Wind and rain hit its pillars. Haste, loss, not good enough choices, regrets of not being able to fulfill too many wishes. But the bridge wouldn't break. Oh, it wouldn't, it wouldn't. It would NOT. How could you picture him dying? He always said, okay. 
Okay
. He raised his chopsticks and gave up two slices of barbecued pork, the honey-colored meat dripping a little translucent sauce while being picked up by 
someone
. He held the winds above the handlebars of his rocking bicycle to girls who couldn't reach the back seat, for they were just starting to grow at that time. 
You sure you don't want to change that antique cellphone?
 They asked him, but they didn't insist, for everyone could recall some gentle memories when the cheerful taiko drumming rained upon the air. He was an ordinary guy, of course. The headaches and fevers he'd gotten were no less than anyone else's, maybe even more. They complained that he was a regular visitor of the room with a white ceiling and faint smell of disinfectant, and even he himself was puzzled by the frequency of bad luck. It didn't matter, though. It would not shake the theory of life and death 
inside
 him. When there were enough incidents to draw a general rule, they found that he never bled. Literally. It was quite natural to reach this conclusion, for a fruit knife had never cut his hand, and never had a bullet involving someone in a conspiracy hit his shoulder as well. Undoubtedly, the dark red liquid flowing under the skin is the medium of life, and you'd see a candle extinguish forever if it drained away. Now everyone was relieved. See, his blood stayed safely in the vessels, then through the muscles and bones, to the surface, conveying reassuring warmth. Just as he always said, it's all right. 
It's all right
. He never dies because he loves so many people. So now they walked to the entrance of the hospital together, quietly watching the white light floating in the corridor slowly recede behind, and met a young nurse, with a bouquet of vibrant golden flowers in her arms. She whispered softly to everyone coming towards her, it was for a child, she said. He was hospitalized here many years ago with a mild cold. We chatted about everything, from childish trio games to future dreams. And on the day he was discharged, he gave me a bouquet of flowers, yes, a bouquet like this. I still don't know how he got it. The moment I took those flowers, well, he closed his eyes as if feeling sleepy, and then, was just gone."

Today he was closer than ever to the mind of Lorlen - even managed to get through the locked door and see him. And from what he saw to lose concentration - in front of him stood Lorlen, as he saw him in their first meeting at the Ceremony. A skinny teenager who happily responded and even tried to grab Akkarin's arm. For a second there was a feeling of thin cold fingers, and then it was gone - Akkarin was again thrown out of Lorlen's consciousness.

Cursing, Akkarin wearily touched Lorlen's arm, causing him to look up blankly. Absolute emptiness and detachment - that's what Akkarin constantly got instead of burning eyes. I so wanted to break this door, but it was impossible - the consciousness, gradually recovering, simply could not withstand such destruction. Then Lorlene won't survive at all and everything will be...

""Don't think about it,"" Akkarin ordered himself. ""Consciousness will be restored and Lorlen will not die.""

Gently touching Lorlen's lips, Akkarin wearily pressed the man to him, stroking his gray head and sending soothing healing energy into Lorlen's body. Then he slowly ran his hand along his back, feeling the wild ripples of scars that crossed the Administrator's entire back. Unfortunately, treatment is unlikely to help - time is lost - but Akkarin was even glad that Lorlen was alive anyway. As crazy as it may sound sometimes.
Akkarin's neck was touched by someone's lips. Laughing softly, Akkarin grabbed Lorlen by the shoulders.- Is there something wrong? - Lorlen raised her head.- No, it's all right, - Akkarin smiled, touching such a beloved and dear face. But he could have lost all this then two years ago. But no...-The feeling of unreality? - Lorlen smiled. The eyes were shining.- Lorlen... - Akkarin began, but was interrupted when Lorlen softly touched his lips.Shaking off all doubts, Akkarin grabbed Lorlen by the arms, turning over so that he was on top. Lorlen laughed, tilting his head.Akkarin smiled - he probably felt that way himself, but Lorlen's face at that moment was a very beautiful sight. A little drunk, but happy expression. The kisses they gave each other. It is beautiful and intoxicates no worse than Dark Anurensky. Beautiful, hot exciting. Watch, enjoy and notice every change in the bright blue eyes, in the soft smile...What he loved and what he does not want to lose - everything is concentrated in one person.And so it will always be."

You might've been thinking that I've always been like this my whole life that my parents were a Red Stinger & a Human or they are both Red Stingers(Yes, female Red Stingers do exist out there).But, what if I told you that this isn't what I always used to look like. What do you mean by that you ask? Well, to make it simple, I wasn't always a hybrid between a Plant & Human which in other words means that my parents were both indeed Human.

And though he did climb up there on occasion, most of the time he never makes it up before drifting to sleep in his brother's arms on the bottom bunk. He secretly prefers it that way, though, and he's certain Gerard does too.Somewhere down the line, it got darker, and the two of them ended up tangled together on the floor, arms wrapped around each other. He hasn't quite reached puberty yet, so he fits in his older brother's arms perfectly. The sticky feeling of Gerard's sweaty skin should be unpleasant, but it isn't. It makes Mikey feel safe. He wouldn't want this any other way.Gerard's breath is warm on his forehead. One of his hands are tangled in Mikey's hair, gently twirling strands in his fingers. His nails are rough on Mikey's scalp, but not rough enough to cause pain.Despite every action being unspoken, both of them are aware of the feelings associated with them. They both long for each other in a way beyond brotherly love. And they both know it.Mikey's heart flutters when Gerard moves his hand from his hair to his lower jaw and plants a kiss on his lips. Mikey moves a hand up and places it on the back of Gerard's neck, his other hand moving to the small of his back. They place their foreheads together, their sweat interlocking and falling to the floor.For the first time, Mikey found comfort in dark silence.He wishes there was a way the two of them could properly express their feelings somewhere that isn't behind closed doors for once. They aren't young anymore, not young enough for it all to be thrown to the side as kids being kids.If there was a way he could go back, a way he could change everything, he would. He would do anything for his older brother.Mikey's head slightly moves up when he hears his name whispered into his ear softly.

He dropped to his knees and couldn’t close his mouth. In a fit of madness he held Gerard’s face between his hands before curling in on himself and screaming, constant, gut-wrenching howls of terror.He was found by a pair of firemen, who had to force him from the wreckage. He was forced in an ambulance and tended to. Frank was barely cognisant of what was happening. His gaze kept moving back to the crumbled remains of the venue. There were so many injured people being tended to, Frank didn’t dare think about the amount of people who hadn’t made it out alive.He was deemed in good state and guided to a police officer. The officer was talking to him and Frank responded, but the conversation didn’t register. All he could see was the blood and the empty look in Gerard’s eyes. His eyes drifted down to the officer’s gun holster as the officer wrote in a notebook.The gun was right within reach. It wouldn’t be hard to grab. How easy would it be, just to take that gun? Frank released a deep breath and then everything went black.The sound of a gun being fired echoed through the night."

Each day, he gets closer and closer to accepting the reality that he’s not making it out alive and Gideon won’t stand for it.One day, around week six, he turns to Dumbledore and says,“I don’t know what else you want from me, I’ve given months of my life to your cause, I’m wanted in several counties for crimes I’ve committed for you. Can’t you finally let my brother go?”Dumbledore refuses him, insisting as he does during their meeting that Gideon dine with him in return for a visit with his brother, said starving brother watching on. Gideon is filled with guilt as he gets fatter and Fabian withers away, as if the weight is coming off of one and going to the other.On this same day, Gideon politely compliments the meal.

LOSERS! COME AND GET ME!"" Tangle screamed, waving her arms wildly in the air to gather attention- taunting them. The soldiers were cautious, for a moment- But that moment was ever so brief as they chased after the lemur, who rolled out of the way as she unleashed a barrage of sword-swings and attacks where she once stood, And, very quickly, her once distressed expression became a smug, proud grin as she pushed the soldiers off the path and down towards Agheel with one fell swoop of her tail, almost like a broom brushing away dust. The soldiers were almost immediately grabbed by the dragon, who tore them apart in a bloody, violent scene that Tangle decided to look away from, ""Phew!"" She spoke as she sighed in relief, turning back to the path. After dealing with the soldiers, Tangle set her sights on a small set of ruins, devoid of any danger or even treasure, just up on a nearby hill. Climbing up the hill, Tangle walked into the ruins- well, more akin to onto the ruins, considering the complete lack of a roof, the ruins essentially being a stone flooring with broken walls. She carefully stepped over the beetles that swarmed the ruins, sharply gazing at the floor- Staring at seemingly nothing, the bandit then stomped her foot as hard as she could against a part of the floor, A portion of the floor fading away to reveal a set of stairs, leading underneath the stone ruins and towards a wooden door. ""Jewel? I'm back!"" Tangle said as she walked down the stairway, the illusionary floor reappearing as she entered the 'basement' of the ruins. The wooden door slowly opened,  revealing a beetle dressed in long, blue robes similar to that of robes from Raya Lucaria Academy- sorcerer's robes, to put it simply. She seemed unusually joyful for a sorcerer, smiling as she let Tangle into the room. It was a small study- a stone room with a bookshelf, multiple desks, and glintstones alongside books littered across the floor. There was a pile of notes sitting next to a bottle of ink, a feather, plus a map of Limgrave. ""Hi, Tangle."" The beetle spoke as Tangle entered, quickly turning away from her and walking over to the scattered note piles- Jewel didn't even seem to notice Tangle's multiple scratches and bruises, too focused on her work to even turn her head. ""Hey, Jewel."" Tangle muttered as she yawned, stretching her arms in the air before leaning against a wall, slowly sliding down onto the floor. Jewel snatched a glintstone, rotating it in her hands as she looked at her notes. ""Tangle, can you-"" Jewel went to ask, going to ask Tangle for help before swiftly noticing her many, many wounds. Jewel was shocked, and clearly concerned- Tangle noticed this, and became slightly nervous. ""Oh my go- Are you okay? Has the scarlet rot been getting worse? Why didn't you tell me about this?"" Jewel continued, rushing over to Tangle and examining the scarlet rot covering her tail. Tangle took a deep breath, before sighing, giving her reply, ""Yeah- No- not really. I got into some trouble with some Godrick soldiers out there, made it out, I just got a couple scratches. The rot's been...progressing, as usual. You- You've gotten close to getting some more medicine though, right?"" She said, becoming sadder as she hoped Jewel had finally gotten the ingredients- Jewel looked like she was beginning to go on the verge of tears, grit her teeth and turned away; ""I...No. I'm so sorry- I just...need a few more days. I won't take too long, I swear."" Tangle knew Jewel wouldn't lie to her- They were friends for so long, But those words were cutting- painful to hear, Tangle flinched as Jewel spoke. But something did catch her eye, as she tried to distract herself from the conversation- A green, shining light, that was never there before, hidden underneath a pile of books. It felt like pure chaos, forced into an object. And Tangle would be sure to investigate it."

She was supposed to have died today.Frank heaved, his stomach rolled at the fucking irony of it all. Gerard had to have survived. Gerard would. Of course Gerard would. He would. They would. He wou-Everything went dim except for what was in front of Frank. There, between his feet, was Gerard’s decapitated, lifeless, face.The make-up was indistinguishable from the real injuries and blood. Frank thought faintly that Gerard was such an amazing artist, before the reality set in and he opened his mouth and screamed. He didn’t know how long he screamed. He dropped to his knees and couldn’t close his mouth. In a fit of madness he held Gerard’s face between his hands before curling in on himself and screaming, constant, gut-wrenching howls of terror.He was found by a pair of firemen, who had to force him from the wreckage. He was forced in an ambulance and tended to. Frank was barely cognisant of what was happening. His gaze kept moving back to the crumbled remains of the venue. There were so many injured people being tended to, Frank didn’t dare think about the amount of people who hadn’t made it out alive.He was deemed in good state and guided to a police officer. The officer was talking to him and Frank responded, but the conversation didn’t register. All he could see was the blood and the empty look in Gerard’s eyes. His eyes drifted down to the officer’s gun holster as the officer wrote in a notebook.The gun was right within reach. It wouldn’t be hard to grab. How easy would it be, just to take that gun? Frank released a deep breath and then everything went black.The sound of a gun being fired echoed through the night."

Each day, he gets closer and closer to accepting the reality that he’s not making it out alive and Gideon won’t stand for it.One day, around week six, he turns to Dumbledore and says,“I don’t know what else you want from me, I’ve given months of my life to your cause, I’m wanted in several counties for crimes I’ve committed for you. Can’t you finally let my brother go?”Dumbledore refuses him, insisting as he does during their meeting that Gideon dine with him in return for a visit with his brother, said starving brother watching on. Gideon is filled with guilt as he gets fatter and Fabian withers away, as if the weight is coming off of one and going to the other.On this same day, Gideon politely compliments the meal. Dumbledore is more agreeable when he is on his best behaviour, and his earlier outburst did not win him any points.“Ah yes, it’s an old family recipe.” Dumbledor accepts his compliments. “Do you know, the meat I tend to prefer is quite tough on its own. I have a special fat that I use in these stews that make it quite a meal. It’s quite good, no?”Gideon agrees. He asks for leftovers. There’s something weird about this stew.During his next mission for Dumbledore, Gideon drops off the stew to a chemist and asks him to test its components.He is horrified to find that it contains meat and fats from humans. That’s right, not just one, but several humans.And he’s been eating it for weeks.Gideon promptly vomits into the nearest bush, and in his spare time over the coming days, finally comes clean to his township about the hold this man has over him by holding his brother hostage. He creates such a discourse in the community, that there’s a witch hunt.They lay in wait, until the door is unlocked and Dumbledore admits Gideon to his home, his walls well and truly down with the gained trust in him, before they storm his castle and take him down.As with all witch hunts, it ends in a bonfire, the man being tied to the main support beam of the cottage, numerous flammable objects surrounding him. As they set the belongings on fire, the flame licking up the fuel soaked woods and flammable materials, the old man's screams ring out through the house.As he died for the suffering he caused, Fabian and Gideon were reunited at last, as twins ought to be.As they basked in the warmth of the flames on the cold winter night, Fabian ate the remaining stewed leftovers, a taste for human flesh. They made a pact to only ever source it ethically."

LOSERS! COME AND GET ME!"" Tangle screamed, waving her arms wildly in the air to gather attention- taunting them. The soldiers were cautious, for a moment- But that moment was ever so brief as they chased after the lemur, who rolled out of the way as she unleashed a barrage of sword-swings and attacks where she once stood, And, very quickly, her once distressed expression became a smug, proud grin as she pushed the soldiers off the path and down towards Agheel with one fell swoop of her tail, almost like a broom brushing away dust. The soldiers were almost immediately grabbed by the dragon, who tore them apart in a bloody, violent scene that Tangle decided to look away from, ""Phew!"" She spoke as she sighed in relief, turning back to the path. After dealing with the soldiers, Tangle set her sights on a small set of ruins, devoid of any danger or even treasure, just up on a nearby hill. Climbing up the hill, Tangle walked into the ruins- well, more akin to onto the ruins, considering the complete lack of a roof, the ruins essentially being a stone flooring with broken walls. She carefully stepped over the beetles that swarmed the ruins, sharply gazing at the floor- Staring at seemingly nothing, the bandit then stomped her foot as hard as she could against a part of the floor, A portion of the floor fading away to reveal a set of stairs, leading underneath the stone ruins and towards a wooden door. ""Jewel? I'm back!"" Tangle said as she walked down the stairway, the illusionary floor reappearing as she entered the 'basement' of the ruins. The wooden door slowly opened,  revealing a beetle dressed in long, blue robes similar to that of robes from Raya Lucaria Academy- sorcerer's robes, to put it simply. She seemed unusually joyful for a sorcerer, smiling as she let Tangle into the room. It was a small study- a stone room with a bookshelf, multiple desks, and glintstones alongside books littered across the floor. There was a pile of notes sitting next to a bottle of ink, a feather, plus a map of Limgrave. ""Hi, Tangle."" The beetle spoke as Tangle entered, quickly turning away from her and walking over to the scattered note piles- Jewel didn't even seem to notice Tangle's multiple scratches and bruises, too focused on her work to even turn her head. ""Hey, Jewel."" Tangle muttered as she yawned, stretching her arms in the air before leaning against a wall, slowly sliding down onto the floor. Jewel snatched a glintstone, rotating it in her hands as she looked at her notes. ""Tangle, can you-"" Jewel went to ask, going to ask Tangle for help before swiftly noticing her many, many wounds. Jewel was shocked, and clearly concerned- Tangle noticed this, and became slightly nervous. ""Oh my go- Are you okay? Has the scarlet rot been getting worse? Why didn't you tell me about this?"" Jewel continued, rushing over to Tangle and examining the scarlet rot covering her tail. Tangle took a deep breath, before sighing, giving her reply, ""Yeah- No- not really. I got into some trouble with some Godrick soldiers out there, made it out, I just got a couple scratches. The rot's been...progressing, as usual. You- You've gotten close to getting some more medicine though, right?"" She said, becoming sadder as she hoped Jewel had finally gotten the ingredients- Jewel looked like she was beginning to go on the verge of tears, grit her teeth and turned away; ""I...No. I'm so sorry- I just...need a few more days. I won't take too long, I swear."" Tangle knew Jewel wouldn't lie to her- They were friends for so long, But those words were cutting- painful to hear, Tangle flinched as Jewel spoke. But something did catch her eye, as she tried to distract herself from the conversation- A green, shining light, that was never there before, hidden underneath a pile of books. It felt like pure chaos, forced into an object. And Tangle would be sure to investigate it."

A random man screamed.Joel peered round the corner with Ellie at his hip, both of their guns out of their holsters. They carefully weaved over the cordyceps making sure not to step on it. Since they'd just managed to escape the explosion that involved Tess after stepping on cordyceps, it wasn't hard to spot it. Silence dragged with them the entire time. Ellie nor Joel had spoke a word to each other. Tess meant a lot to the both of them-""CARSON, FUCK OFF!!"" Another squeaky-ish voice perked up. Joel sighed and jogged towards the wall, finally spotting them. One of them was almost his height, maybe 5'11. His hair was black and scraggly, curls untamed like he hadn't washed for days. A lot of his visible skin was caked in dirt, dust and more. There was a possible chance he was caught by the explosion. Judging by the third degree burns on his arm, leading up to his bicep, Joel's suspicions was correct.And the other one.. well. He was average height, around 5'8. He had equally untamed hair which was vanilla blonde- Joel couldn't tell because his hair was disgustingly dark due to the dirt and rubble and whatever was caught in there. But for some reason they were both inches away from each other, arms flailing and screaming.Ellie was taking to Joel but he was simply too fixated on the two men stood a few yards away. Finally, the 14 year old stomped a few times and caught Joel's attention. But they also caught the attention of the two arguing men. Whilst Joel's eyes were torn away, the two fled to a hidden spot in the broken building.""What are you doing, Joel?"" Exclaimed Ellie. ""Are you going to kill them, or are you going to eyefuck them all day? Come on, they're right over there-"" Ellie gestured with her hand to the spot the two men were originally in, but no one was there.""Fuck off, Ellie."" Joel said quietly, looking around. His shoulder was right up against the brick, head poking round the side. Ellie threw her tantrum, telling Joel how slow he'd gotten and how every person they come across, he's too slow to act. The last person they came across Ellie had shot in the head because Joel was struggling to even keep up.""Whatever. Just help me track them."" Joel mumbled out.""No need."" A deeper voice spat out. Ellie and Joel looked up in unison and one of the men was standing on the bricks towering above them. ""Right here.""Both Joel and Ellie hit the floor.""Now what do we do, Car-car?"" The one on the floor wiped his gun. He'd just pistol-whipped both Joel and Ellie. Now they had one grown man and a teenage girl knocked out on the floor.Carson leapt down off the bricks and bent his knees so he didn't hurt his ankles, before getting up and grabbing the other by his shirt scruff.""Call me Car-Car again and I'll shoot you right between the eyes, Michael."" Carson shook his head, letting Michael go. Michael brushed his shirt off as the other walked over to Joel and grabbed his arms, placing his wrists behind his back and zip-tying him up. Getting the hint, Michael did the same to Ellie. In which two seconds later, Carson had left and appeared back with two horses.Western style, they lifted Joel up together and hoisted him on the back of the horse."

“ like it was calling to me. “

“ trying to make me the sixth missing person. “
 
grimacing, she shook her shoulders forward, shutting her eyes in annoyance at the dust that scattered across the room at that simple movement. it covered everything in this house. even it’s weirdly ominous walls. ( how the hell does dust coat the walls? )
 
“ didn’t know i signed up for ghost hunting.. “
 
floorboards creaked as she took a step forward, her converse pressing down the rotten wood, and nearly breaking through it. she didn’t like that detail, it made her feel uneasy. how old is this house? it has to be older than her. 
 
the house smelled like rot and mold. that’s the first think she noted when she pushed through the poorly boarded up front door. it only took a few shoves before the boards gave through and collapsed into a heap in the living room. yet the further she went, the worse it got. it was followed by an oddly metallic smell as well. like she was trapped in a room with iron walls. 
 
“ HELLO? “ she called, letting out a wheeze like cough as she inhaled dust, quickly covering her mouth.
 
“ ugh. “ she choked out. “ i hate this. “ 
 
uncovering her mouth, she felt inside her bag that rested by her waist, and pulled out her camera. it was heavy in her hands, and the fabric of the small handle like accessory dragged uncomfortably across her wrist. 
 
“ just gotta find some proof of the people, and then i can get out of here. “ she muttered, turning her attention away from the floors and sheet-covered furniture, to the staircase. it’s steps were oddly steep, and the walls surrounding it were narrow. only one person would be able to take the steps at a time, which confused her, as this was apparently a ‘ family house. ‘
 
narrowing her eyes at it, she started to it, before pausing.
 
“ odd. i swear i saw something. “ she grumbled. “ it’s probably nerves— “
 
quickly walking up, she stared at the camera in her hands, hitting the top of it a few times with the heel of her hand a few times, before—
 
“ ACK! “
 
oh. great. she should’ve been paying attention. because maybe then she would notice the caved in broken floorboards at the top of the stairs. her shoe caught the edge of the top stair, and she panicked, the shock tilting her backwards and nearly tumbling down.
 
she would’ve, if it wasn’t for the fact that she felt something grab the front of her shirt.

Hyung. Hyung. Hyung.
When Yohan reached the mansion and frantically patched up the wound on the man's back, it's only then did he realize that his brother's already dead, and before him lied the man with his brother's face. His heart stuttered, hands faltered, mind puzzled, at the harsh truth. And when Elijah looked at Kim Gaon and then at him with that distraught expression, Yohan felt like he'd betrayed her, like he's the one who'd robbed her of her parents and life forever.
Elijah. I'm so sorry, Elijah.
When Yohan fell asleep that one night, the fire didn't haunt his dream for once. Instead, he found himself in the room, standing next to where Kim Gaon was resting. But it's not Kim Gaon lying in the bed. His heart clenched and his stomach churned at the face covered with blood and ashes. And when his brother spoke, breathing became increasingly hard for Yohan until he jerked awake in the dark bedroom, body soaked with sweat and face wet with tears.
“You think you can fix everything, Yohan-ah?”
He couldn't. Of course, he couldn't. So when Yohan forced himself to check up on Kim Gaon's condition came morning, he couldn't find it in him to meet his eyes, especially when Kim Gaon looked at and spoke to him kindly and without suspicion for the first time.“Well, I suppose I should thank you for treating me these past few days, bujang-nim.”“Mm,” Yohan said, then left in disarray."

Only to leave me with nothing. The strap of my bag slips from my shoulder and lands on the gravel road when I am about to step onto the bus. Sighing, I bend down to pick up my bag, but another hand already beats it to me.Raising my head, my eyes lock with the familiar pair of green eyes. Shock is evident on both of our faces. Not once I have thought today will be the day where I will see him after almost one year... the day when I am at my weakest point.The last memory which I have of him, is of the last year, him signing off the divorce papers.putting an end to our happily ever after.""Hi,"" Clearing his throat, he speaks.His deep voice brings back all the memories which I have kept buried in my heart for the last year.""Hey,"" I reply, tearing my gaze away from him.""How are you?"" He asks.""Good."" I nod.""Going home for Thanksgiving?"" He let out a small forced chuckle, trying to make small talk.Home? Where is home? The studio apartment where I have been living alone for the past year or the empty house that is waiting for me in the small town which used to be my home…Maybe I am still trying to figure where the home is.""No, going there to attend some unfinishedbusiness,"" I say impassively, locking down my every emotion which comes alive when I think about how within few months my life completely turned upside down.Not wanting to divulge anything more than I have said, I climb inside the bus withoutlooking back at him.He follows me inside the bus and takes his seat across the aisle a few seats away from mine.I can sense him stealing glances in my direction but never once I look at him.I can't blame him for the divorce, we both were at fault. But still, it hurts to know he never decided to give us a chance to work on our differences. Our relation took a backseat for him as his work became a priority. I never wanted him to choose between his work and me because I know how much struggles he had faced reaching the position where he is now. But I also have a limit.

Teccho's face was burning red; his eyes were tightly shut. The blind soldier Saigiku, was hiding under the dashboard sucking the other's penis. They were getting impatient so they decided to pound inside Teccho's car. Well, it's late at night, who would even do this in the very late hour other than the Hunting Dogs ensemble?
""Jouno..."" Teccho called. He hoped that he would never get used to the feeling of Jouno's cold mouth on his penis. It was both enjoyable for them.
If Saigiku would dive down deeper, then he would presumingly cough. It was uncomfortable kneeling down under the driver's seat but having a penis in his mouth is distracting. He was licking, kissing and sucking away as Teccho moaned his name out.
Teccho let out a loud moan as Saigiku got his mouth filled with semen. The blind soldier stood up to straddle over the other's lap, opened his mouth and poured half of the semen on his mouth. He swallowed the rest of the half and began kissing him with heat. He felt his own buttocks get massaged by the other soldier.
""Jouno."" Teccho broke the kiss. ""Not here.""
""Huh?""
""If I make a stain here, they'll think that I made the stain. But I know where we can go."" He opened the door and got out of the car to hide behind a nearby bush.
They'd make out first by kissing each other's bodies and lips. They were both heated with passion as they were feeling impatient for making love. Soon, the dead night would be filled with two soldiers moaning, groaning, huffing and their skin slapping. Teccho was thrusting Saigiku on face-to-face. He was going a little harder than what he wanted but he loved Saigiku so much.
Saigiku's throat was in mild pain as he screamed Teccho's name. He knew once this is over, he will be in his bored state again. But for now, he will feel the absolute bliss in his body.
""Don't stop, Teccho.""
Teccho was thrusting Saigiku with full force, nibbling his shoulder as well.
""Teccho,"" Saigiku moaned as he felt his prostate gland being abused by the other soldier's penis. ""I-I'm gonna-"" he cried out as he ejaculated.
Teccho grunted as he ejaculated deep inside the blind soldier. He ejaculated so much it was leaking out of him and onto his legs.
Teccho pulled out and said,""Was that too much?""
""No… it's fine. I love it."" Saigiku replied.
The two of them kissed again and suddenly a tiny hand tugged the blind soldier's hair causing them to break the kiss and turn around. What popped through the bush was Teruko and her hand holding the flashlight. She was told to find the two missing soldiers and she did not expect them have an intercourse in the bush.
""Oh no! Not again!"" Teruko squealed."

But there was one difference, it wasn't home. He'd known that he was homesick, Everyone were.
As he looked down to his feet, he felt himself crying. Tears dropping to the ocean of this lonely planet. Was he selfish for wanting to leave everything he had here in space to go back home? To his ocean, not this copycat of an ocean. He wanted to feel the salty water that he used to swim in since a child. He even missed the sharks that used to hunt fishes there in the water that he were scared of. If only the ocean could tell him. His mother used to say that if don't know what to do, ask the ocean as it'll know exactly what to do.oh, how he missed his mother. he misses her hugs, her food and most of all, her voice.

From the moment he pretended to defect to Shadow’s side, he seemed to hang around him like he was reluctant to let him out of his sight. It could have simply been the fact that Shadow trusted no one and wanted to keep an eye on him, but his actions seemed to hint at another reason. As did the constant casual touches; on his arms, his shoulders, pale fingers constantly reaching out to make contact with clothing but never skin.It reminded Vio somewhat of Red, but if he had been trying to hold back. Or maybe Blue if he needed to touch the others but couldn’t bring himself to do it properly. It was then that he realized how badly Shadow craved contact but feared it at the same time.That evening, looking out over Death Mountain together, Vio had taken his chance to test his theory. His hand surreptitiously brushed against Shadow’s as he leaned against the window ledge, gazing out over their domain. He pretended not to notice the way Shadow flinched back, recoiling from him as though the contact burned, only to carefully replace his hand in almost the same spot like he was hoping Vio would do it again.It was late that night, exhausted and shaken from the destruction he had watched befall the forests and villages under Shadow’s command, when Vio decided to act. Horrified though he was about his dark counterpart’s disregard for life, he knew there was more to Shadow than his thirst for destruction. He was a part of the heroes too. He was already letting down his guard; targeting an obvious weak point and using it to confuse and distract him would absolutely shatter his defenses, giving Vio the chance he needed to do what he had to do.He wondered if he was more disgusted with Shadow or with himself.“That was fun,” Shadow commented with a grin, stretching both arms over his head as he straightened up on the dragon’s back. He leaped, landing almost soundlessly on the balcony beside which the beast was hovering. “Still, we can’t destroy everything too fast. What’s the point of ruling if there’s nobody left to fear you?”“That’s a good point,” Vio responded, positioning his feet carefully on the beast’s back as he prepared to jump. He cleared the gap easily and landed beside Shadow, stumbling at the impact. In an instant his hand had come up and grasped hold of Shadow’s.Shadow stiffened immediately as Vio regained his balance and straightened up. He glanced briefly at their joined hands as though surprised, then at Shadow’s face. “Sorry.” Carefully he relaxed his grip but didn’t withdraw, watching intently for any sign he might have pushed too far and lost his chance.Shadow’s fingers tightened around his, sharpened nails pressing into skin.Vio let his eyes drift to their hands again before he spoke abruptly. “Shadow, I wanted to say thank you. Without you I never would have realized my true potential. I feel like you’re the only one I can call a friend.”“A friend?” Shadow repeated, still looking thoroughly distracted by the hand in his own.“Yes. I’m glad we can rely on each other.” He brought up his other hand, briefly clasping Shadow’s between both of his own, before letting go. Pointed fingernails scraped pleadingly against the back of his hand as he let it drop and began to walk away into the tower.“Wait.”A flicker of a smile crossed his face briefly before he turned, raising an eyebrow. Shadow caught up, fingers hovering uncertainly over Vio’s hand for a moment before he slipped his hand into his light counterpart’s again. “Me too. I mean, I’m glad you came to your senses. I didn’t want to have to kill you too.”His breathing was shallow as he held on tightly, standing closer to Vio than he had all night. The purple-clothed Hylian raised his other eyebrow. “Are you all right?”“… Mm.” Tentatively Shadow leaned against his side. They stayed like that for a moment before he abruptly seemed to pull himself together and let go, taking a step back. “I’m tired. We may as well get some rest if we’re going to be finishing off those other two heroes tomorrow.”Vio caught a glimpse of the moisture clinging to Shadow’s eyelashes as he spun away. He strode quickly into the tower and Vio followed, knowing that he would be left alone for the rest of the night. All of the pieces were now in place for the final part of his plan.And he hated himself for it."

It irks him, just a little.",English,783,1/1,6,31,6,119,"|Seungmin-ah, do you want to go on a date with me or with Minho? |

 

 

Seungmin has to blink a few times as he processes the question, a niggling feeling at the back of his mind telling him that he’s forgetting something. 
 

He looks up from his phone and his eyes land on Minho who’s slumped on the opposite end of the couch. He's engrossed in his phone, probably watching cute cat videos on YTShorts, eyes drooping from listlessness. 
 

Seungmin kicks his shin. 
 

“OW! What the fuck?!” he jumps, jolting up to sit straight. He levels Seungmin with a glare that promises generations of pain and suffering, his anger exuding from him in waves. “

Seungmin-ah. 

Do you wanna 

die?” 

he asks, a cloying smile on his face despite the venom in his tone. 
 

Seungmin mirrors his expression, eyes narrowing into slits and lips pulled in a taut arch, and immediately Minho’s fury falters. “

Minho-yah. 

Do 

you 

wanna die?” 
 

His boyfriend looks puzzled now, lips pulled in a confused pout. “What?” 
 

Seungmin sighs, exasperated and frankly, 

offended. 

Their rare off day in literal ages and his dumbass boyfriend doesn’t even remember his own promises. He looks back to his phone and decides to react to the question on bubble with an angry emoji before turning it off and shifting on the couch. He disentangles his legs from Minho’s, the man still regarding him with a wary glare, and crawls over to him until he’s straddling him, pinning the other down into the couch. Minho's hands shot up to grab his waist on reflex. 
 

Seungmin leans down until his lips are practically touching Minho’s reddening ears and speaks with an exhale. “You’re forgetting something, 

baby.” 

He enunciates the nickname on purpose—knows it’ll get on Minho’s nerves since he hates being called sappy terms of endearment. 
 

“And what exactly am I forgetting, 

jagi?” 

 

He’s also very aware of how Seungmin hates the same thing. 
 

Two can play that game. 
 

“

Yeobo,” 

Seungmin whines, collapsing on top of Minho and smushing against him. He can practically hear the eye-roll in his sigh. “You promised me a date.” he speaks into his collarbone, melting into the arms Minho wrapped around his middle. 
 

“That’s it?” 
 

Seungmin pulls back with a scandalized gasp and pinches Minho’s arm when he doesn’t even attempt to bite back his laughter. 
 

“That’s 

it?! 

Fuck it, I'm filing for a divorce.” 
 

Minho throws his head back on unhinged cackles and tightens his hold on Seungmin. “We’d need to be married first, Seungmo.”
 

Seungmin glares. “We’ll get married and then divorce right after.” 
 

Minho gasps, dramatic and cheesy, with a hand on his mouth and everything. “Are you 

proposing 

right now?” His eyes are wide and glittering, the embodiment of awestruck and over-the-top joy. Before Seungmin can rebut, however, his face drops into a blank stare. “Cause my answer is no.” 
 

“Fuck you-” Seungmin pinches both Minho’s cheeks, pulling them hard enough that he knows it hurts as he laughs at Minho’s ear-piercing banshee screeches. 
 

“

Kim Seungmin.” 

Minho grits, words garbled from Seungmin’s juvenile assault. He deliberately squeezes Seungmin’s ass in retaliation, though all that achieves is making Seungmin regard him with a self-satisfied smirk. 
 

“Yah, you tryna distract me with sex? Not happening 

jagi, 

we’re going on that date.” 
 

“Ugh,” Minho groans, imbued with all the misery and suffering he endures in the hands of his cruel boyfriend. “I hate you.”
 

Seungmin chuckles, cupping both of Minho’s cheeks as he leans his face closer. “And now you’re gonna have to pay for everything, hyungie.” 
 

“Oh 

please

, as if I don’t do that already.” he grumbles.
 

“Hmm~ I love you.” He pecks him on the lips, pulling back with a soft grin. 
 

“You suck.” Minho says, opening his eyes and frowning at his boyfriend. 
 

“How very mature you are, my boyfriend who’s two whole centuries older than I am.” 
 

“Yah!” Minho swiftly flips their positions, tackling Seungmin onto the couch and weighing down on him. Seungmin squirms under him, complaining about how he can’t breathe. “I’ll dropkick you into the 24
th
 century and then we’ll see who’s old.” 
 

“You can do whatever you want after our 

date.” 

Seungmin smirks at him.
 

“Ugh, fine, I expect you to be ready in fifteen minutes.” Minho relents, head lolling and nose brushing against Seungmin’s. Seungmin loops his arms around his neck and pulls him into a deep kiss. 
 

“Where’re we going?” he asks once they separate. 
 

“It’s a surprise.” Minho grins, giving him one last peck before taking off towards his room. 
 

Seungmin follows, anticipation bubbling in his belly. He thinks of the bubble post and mentally thanks the OP for unintentionally reminding him of their date."

The way he'd watch quietly, his hands tensing as he tried to resist before lightly pushing the other boy away from the stove top, brows knitted in concentration as he focused on cooking breakfast despite whining that he had been too tired mere moments before.He adores him at the dining table where he'd messily stuff his face full of whatever meal they decided to have and Toya would have to reach over and gently dab off any leftover food that scattered over his lips. It's a habit he's embarrassed about but Toya loves him nonetheless.He adores him even when he whined when Toya announces he has to leave for work, making the face of a kicked puppy as if he wouldn't return like he does every day.He adores the way he asked ""Aren't you forgetting something?"" only for Toya to swivel around and give him a kiss on his perfect nose, soft cheeks, and lips. The way he still got flustered after all these years and muttered a soft, ""I-I meant your keys…""He adores the way he'd always left little text messages every few hours while he waited for him to get home. Small messages reminding him to eat or just life updates about how he'd fallen over while walking or what he'd heard latest from Ena's art career.He adores the way he'd try to be subtle, (but always fail under Toya's observant view,) to act like he didn't perk up like a dog at the sound of his partner coming home. The way he'd softly ask ""How was work?"" Always prepared with a response that'd make him feel whole and comforted whether it was a good or bad day.He adores how he'd still sing as he cooked dinner, body swaying to his own beat. It'd been long since they'd surpassed RAD WEEKEND, but that didn't mean he or their friends had stopped music at all. It just happened to take a backseat for the moment as other details of life took priority. And yet, it still seeped out of every part of Akito.He adores how they'd get ready for bed together, taking a show before. He'd run his hands through Akito's hair with a content smile, eyes softening with pure, unabashed love for the man before him, fingers working against his scalp and between ginger locks in gentle strokes.He adores the night sky as it casts over them while he dragged Akito to bed with him, even as he complained he's not tired. He was starkly aware of his partner's struggle with insomnia, but he didn't mind. He was here to help, and to love, and to forever cherish every aspect of Akito that said man couldn't about himself.He adores the slow heartbeat as he laid against Akito's chest like a loving rhythm that lulled him into a comfortable sleep knowing the one who kept him safe and warm would always be by his side.He adores that, despite how grumpy he can seem on the outside, he pressed a kiss to his temple so delicately as if he'd break apart like glass. It was a gesture of so much care and unspoken words of needing to protect one another.And as he falls asleep, he adores how they will do it all again tomorrow. He will continue to cherish and love the partner that he was given because Akito is nothing but pure love itself.

Alone in his room in the top of the Slat he sat with a bottle of brandy. He could master this, if for no reason other than for her. “I will have you without your armor Kaz Brekker or I will not have you at all” those were the words she had said to him aboard the Ferolind. He wanted her, and she wanted him but only without his armor. He could do that. He took off his gloves and tossed them on the desk. He could best this. He remembered the last time he had tried. He felt a wave of sickness run through him as the memory of Beni’s flesh passed through his mind, then Jordie’s, bloated, greying, and cold. So cold. The water was rising around him. He grabbed for his cane. The familiar weight a reassurance. He took a swig of brandy. It made him feel warm. He took another swig. He thought of those stolen minutes in the bathroom of the Geldrenner. The look on Inej’s face as he had said those awful things when he had recoiled, overcome by this sickness and his hate. What if he couldn’t do this, he was going to fail her. He felt the waters rising around his legs. He growled and took another swig of brandy. He wouldn’t fail. He had never failed. Not in the Ice Court job, not in taking down Van Eck, and not in taking down Pekka Rollins. The water was cold around his leg and all he could see was the cold empty look in Jordie’s eyes. But he had earned his revenge for Jordie. He braced himself on his cane, he thought of Pekka bent on his knees in front of his crew begging Kaz. And it made the memory of Jordie’s gaze easier. I brought you vengeance brother. But the water did not recede. Kaz was no longer drowning but he could not pull away. He took another swig of brandy desperate to feel warm. He turned and stared at his windowsill, the one Inej used to sit on and feed crows from. He was going to miss that. Then suddenly the memory that came to him as the baleen had run out returned to him now, Inej's on that very sill feeding the crows  “You shouldn’t make friends with crows,” he’d told her. “Why not?” she had asked. “They don’t have any manners.” He had said, it wasn’t very funny but she had laughed, that beautiful sound reverberated through his mind and then the water receded. His knuckles were white on his cane and he was sweaty but he was in his room in the Slat. He had done it, he had faced the memory and didn’t flinch. It wasn’t nearly the same as feeling skin but it was a first step. He could do this. For her and with her.He’d continued trying to practice not wearing his gloves around the Slat, it’s the only place he felt comfortable enough doing it, and besides that way there would be no hit to the rumors about his hands. He started simple, dealing one night at cards, gloves off. When he had come down with them in his pocket and not on everyone had stared but no one had said a word. They were happy to have him play cards with him, and no one tried to touch him. The second time he did it Anika’s hand had touched his as he reached to take her cards. He had to bite down on his tongue to stop the tremor from visibly running through his body and he felt the water around his legs as he sat around the table, all the noises becoming muddled and deafened. “It’s not easy for me either” that’s what she’d said. He thought of her, and the water receded some. He had turned in after that hand, and if anyone noticed anything they didn’t say. He slept that night with his gloves on. But each day for the next week he spent some time with his gloves off in the presence of others."

The feast before them was in full swing, everyone sat leisurely around the stage while they celebrated the successful rescue of Lesser Lord Kusanali, the reinstatement of General Mahamatra, and the overthrow of the sages.A sharp pain pierced within her chest, like a spear that lay dormant had just solidified inside of her lungs. Lumine inhaled sharply, only loud enough for her fairy friend to notice and tilt her head in concern. The traveller nodded numbly as she let Paimon believe that the remedy for this sudden change was more delicious food. Her little friend floated away to select the most mouth-watering morsels to bring back to her travelling partner.Lumine let her gaze sweep the room as the pain in her chest grew into a throbbing ache and bloated into her stomach. Her initial response was to find someone who could understand, someone to reach out to and have her fears squashed, but as she looked over her friends – Paimon, Dunyarzad, Dehya, Nilou, Cyno, Alhaitham – that pain inside her turned black and began to drag talons along her ribcage.The grief of watching the world around her go on as if Greater Lord Rukkhadevata never existed would not have been as horrendous if she could open up and share this pain, address it and discuss it with someone. If they could just hear her recount of what happened, whether they thought her insane or took her story into consideration, would at the very least satisfy the sorrow of losing yet another person on her travels. It would stop the growing beast within her from tearing at her heart, and if she acted quick enough then maybe it would be vanquished all together before it utterly consumed her.She felt the monster within her seep into her throat and her eyes unfocused to the space in front of her. Even Lesser Lord Kusanali – Nahdia, so full of curiosity and wisdom – was someone she could not confide this truth in. They had fought so hard to rid the world of the infection of Forbidden Knowledge, surely if Lumine were to voice the truth it would just bring the poison back to Irminsul again and the Greater Lord’s sacrifice would have been for nought.The taste of blood drifted to her attention and Lumine realised she had been biting the inside of her mouth below her lip. She let her tongue run over the wound as she was pulled out of her spiralling and her resolve began to form.Her golden gaze, now dripping with sorrow, returned to caress the sight of her friends again. They were happy. Merriment and a lazy, relaxed kind of joy fizzed in the air like a blanket of warmth that she could no longer take comfort in. The reality of her situation caressed her mind like a cruel lover making her watch as the beast within her chest dulled its claws but refused to let go, settling into its new nest to stay.Memories of all the times she had felt content along her travels, the kind of happiness that had made her feel like she had a home among her friends, began to be tainted as they replayed in her mind. The wicked voice in her ear breathed taunts of how utterly naïve and stupid she had been to believe that those moments were hers to cherish. The moments themselves had been the ones to own her – had been the ones to sweetly pull her away from the very reason she was travelling across this world in the first place. The voice laughed at her and forced her to watch as each memory was polluted and shattered under this new perspective.Lumine’s reality changed before her very eyes and the monster in her chest purred at the bitterness that swam in her head.With one last glance around the room, the smiles of her friends being cemented to a new bittersweet meaning, she turned her back to the group and slipped away from the stage like an unnoticed shadow. Her ultimate goal of finding her sibling was her main focus once again, as it should have been the entire time.The heels on her boots clicked softly as her feet met the pavement outside of the Grand Bazaar. Gripping the strap of her backpack tighter, the traveller made her way towards the Sanctuary of Surasthana to seek the next clue of her brother’s whereabouts with new determination. His memory now held the promise of comfort from the beast within her – surely she would be able to spill all her pains and troubles to him and then she would be rid of this creature under her skin.A tear slipped down her stone-cold expression as she glanced back at the now closed door behind her. From now on, she would distance herself from those she couldn’t risk tainting with the Forbidden Knowledge – from those she believed she couldn’t open up to ever again.Whether it was the monster in her chest, the poisonous voice in her ear or her new resolve itself, a decision was made; her travels would now be ones of solitude as the risks and potential distractions would only be her downfall.She must find her brother and until then – until they could leave this world – she would be on her own. Perhaps this world would forget her just the same as the once celebrated Lord of Sumeru. Lumine, the revered traveller, would either become nothing but a legend or one who never existed at all. Either way, it was time to go."

Even if Ino had initially been worried that Sakura would suffer once again because of him, she could see how happy they were together. She was reassured to see them like this.“Do you know what you could offer her ?”Sasuke looked at the flowers carefully. He stopped in front of carnations.“I'll take carnations.”Ino frowned. It was not Sakura's favorite flowers.“Are you sure ?”He nodded.“She had a bunch of carnations at her apartment when I came back. And when we went on a mission, when we were genin, she picked some on the way back.”He smiled slightly. Ino was surprised to see that he remembered a small detail that had taken place many years ago. She knew he had not been wrong. He had chosen with his heart. She took the carnations, prepared them and arranged them in a bouquet. She mixed them with other flowers to give harmony to the bouquet, while asking Sasuke's opinion. He paid and left the store.The next day, Ino went to Sakura's for lunch. She saw the flowers Sasuke had bought in a vase.“Nice bouquet,” Ino said.Sakura blushed and smiled.“Sasuke-kun gave them to me.”She approached and sniffed the flowers. Ino was reassured for her friend. She finally got the happy ending she deserved.

The mellow smell is always refreshing. She rocked the cup to let the milk be steamed into fine milk froth, and then covered it on the coffee. She held the cup up to the tip of her nose, took a deep breath, and showed a satisfied smile on her face.She wanted to make another cup for her lover. Her soft blonde hair slipped from her temples, and she raised her hand to comb the hair behind her ears.At this moment, Crypto came over. He leaned against the door frame and saw that the apron outlined Wattson's waistline in a perfect arc —she always wears insulating clothing, so he rarely has the opportunity to appreciate her excellent figure.Crypto took a few steps forward, hugged Wattson from behind, and put his arms around her waist casually. Wattson turned half a circle in his arms, raised her head to kiss his cheek.“Natalie，I am starving.Do you have to do it now？”“Taejoon——”Wattson pushed Park Tae-joon to sit on the chair, stepped on it, and lay on him, with her soft breast squeezed on his chest. Crypto could only hold Wattson's thigh and hug her up.Natalie is always lively and active in sex. In many cases, she wants to have some very close contact with her boyfriend - for example now.Wattson stroked the metal around Crypto's eyes and looked at the eyes blinking slowly. She lowered her head to close to Crypto's chin skin and metal link, stretched out her tongue to lick the crack, then found his lips,given it a gentle touch.The same aroma of coffee was tasted in their mouths."

 ‘Bout streams with islands in 

 With Kermit on the ABC 

And Darren Criss was host

 To some entertaining ghosts 

Jack Black got shaved for all to see

 Then there was a spook 

For Mark Hamill and Luke

 Until Gonzo set Chewie free 

 Then at a deadly pace 

 It came from outer space 

 Just in time to be on TV

I saw Liza Minelli

 Sing some songs on the telly 

 And it really turned me into a fan 

 And the tears that were shed 

When I saw Once said Fred

 Sing too sexy with a muppet band 

Vincent Price’s neck bitten

 And I really was smitten 

 When I heard ‘bout it on the newsstand. 

 And a pirate captain 

 Who found some treasure was trapped in

Grabbing the bedsheets tightly feels like too much now, he’s too tired. Like a truck run him over and put him to lay down afterwards.
Eventually, the almost complete silence encourages him to sleep, and he falls into dreams with the noise of the wind hitting the windows as a lullaby.
When he wakes up, he feels somehow lighter. Just a bit. It’s not enough for him to feel strong enough to get up and leave the bed, but at least he feels more conscious. There is, however, a stinging sensation, like he needs to be alert. Something might be wrong.
That sensation almost vanishes when his brother enters the room, greeting him with his ever-present smile. His hair looks perfect, Erik always looks perfect.
“Hey, brother”, he walks over to the bed and moves a chair to sit beside the bed and keep him company.
“How do you feel?”
“Better”, Wille sighs, but it comes to his attention how much his throat hurts. He rubs at it softly, moving his neck left and right. The pain doesn’t leave.
Erik is carrying something, he’s holding it with his hands in a way in which Wille can’t see what it is, but once he lays it down in his lap, Wille can make up a round shape.
Soon enough, Erik takes it into his hands again and shows it to him. “I got you this. A new snow globe”. In it, there are two frogs. One is wearing a scarf and the other one a beanie, and they play in the snow. The scene feels familiar, but Wille can’t pinpoint why.
He makes grabby hands for it like a child, groaning. He feels bad again.
Erik puts it in his hands and gives him a forehead kiss. Then, a proper one, since at first, he was checking his temperature. “You’re very hot, still”.
“I don’t feel well… Thank you for the gift”. Wille tries to shake it in his hands but it slips out of his reach and falls onto the bed. Luckily, it doesn’t break, not even a scratch, as it landed in a soft surface.
His brother laughs at his clumsiness, which is definitely improved by his sickness.
“I’m here, little brother”.
“Erik?”
“Yeah?”
“Erik”.
“I’m in pain too, Wille…”
Erik disappears. He’s gone? He left without letting him know?
Wille gasps and wakes up. Sweat covering his forehead, some falling in his torso and he sits up in bed. It feels like a cold strong hand is grabbing at his heart or twisting his stomach. A punch to the gut. Images of fast cars, an ambulance and sirens, all appear and disappear in his mind. The funeral, the soil on top of the casket, mum’s handkerchief, the condolences and the hugs.
But right now, he’s in his room. His brother is gone. His snow globe isn’t there. A single tear escapes and he feels drained once again. It makes him fall asleep once more. This time, his knuckles white as he’s grabbing the bedsheets, holding on for dear life.When Simon enters the room to check on him, he can see a pained expression on his still soft honey face. He has brought a new clean shirt for his boyfriend. Simon admires his freckles and soft dimples, he’s beautiful even when he’s ill.
He wants to caress his face but is afraid of waking him up. Instead, he pets his hair carefully and slowly. Wille’s fingers let go of the sheets. His whole body loses some of the tension it was carrying, and finally, he sleeps peacefully. No delirium and no pain.Simon falls into bed next to him, curled up, taking as little space as possible, seeming more like a pet than human. He wraps his arms around Wille and matches his breathing to his in a deep, real slumber."

Elizabeth narrowed her eyes dangerously. “And you’re certain this technology poses no risk…?”“McKay says it’s totally harmless.” He’d switched back to the snowfall setting, flakes appearing to land in his hair but disappearing instantly on contact. Just an illusion. “Maybe some Ancients just missed the seasonal changes on Earth.”“Hmm.” She moved to stand next to him, her attempt to appear unconvinced not fooling him, and he grinned. “Come onnn, you know you love it — snow for December, without the cold.”“It is beautiful,” she admitted quietly, watching the snow glitter in the golden light. She tilted her head back, regarding the jewel-like stars that had began to appear in the deepening blue sky when something hanging from the glowing beam above them caught her eye.“John…” Her eyes narrowed dangerously as she shot him a glance. “What’s that above us?”“What?” He glanced up quickly, eyes immediately widening. “What the — I didn’t put it there, I swear!”  The mischievous faces of a certain physicist, Athosian, and Satedan as they conspired with the gate tech immediately appeared in his mind’s eye. He grimaced slightly.“Looks like someone told Teyla about certain holiday customs on Earth.” Elizabeth’s eyes locked with his again, though the corners of her mouth twitched into the slightest smirk. “As I understand it, this is basically an Athosian version of mistletoe…”“…and bad fortune may come to those who don’t observe the…customary ritual.” He licked his lips nervously. “Ah well, I’m sure ignoring it wouldn’t pose any real threat…”“Well, I’d rather not take any chances.” She had moved closer, a mischievous expression on her face while she held him in a steady gaze. “…particularly not in this galaxy. Though only if you feel the same, of course…”“What? Uh…yeah…” The realization that this was actually happening sent his mind spinning, and he mentally shook himself, barely stifling the grin that threatened to spread across his face. “Absolutely.”“Good,” she breathed, and with that she closed the gap between them, pulling him into a deep kiss. Deep but languid, her hands in his hair and the snow swirling around them, the soft sigh of the ocean below as they held the kiss till lack of air forced them apart.They faced each other, breathless, and he was struck by her beauty, her face illuminated by the golden light while the snowflakes caught for an instant in her dark hair. He reached out to caress her cheek, finding her smirking again.“Maybe we should do it again,” she murmured, quirking an eyebrow. “…just to be safe.”He grinned back, leaning in close. “Probably for the best,” he whispered, then captured her lips for a second time.*"

Koi looks up to see a washcloth flying at him, and he deftly catches it with one hand before using it to dry off the jug in his hand. It’s after-hours at the tavern, and the only sounds that can be heard are the clinking of cups being dried and bottles being rearranged. An old jukebox in the corner of the tavern, usually surrounded by drunk patrons, plays smooth jazz, and the entire place is settled within a soft orange glow that he has come to associate with home. 

With 

Ann. 


The Twi’lek in mention is grinning at him from over the bar, having finished his job of wiping down the tables in the main room. In his hand is a glass that Koi identifies as one he’d 

just 

dried, half-filled with a honey-gold drink of some sort. He gives Ann a look, and the other man only takes a sip in return. 

“Nice catch.”

Koi sets down the jug in his hand and slings the cloth over his shoulder, leaning on the edge of the bar and in towards Ann. “What, you thought I wouldn’t catch it?”

From this position, Koi is able to look up at his boyfriend through his lashes, weaponizing a gaze that he knows Ann can’t resist. A faint blush rises in Ann’s cheeks and Koi has to bite his lower lip to keep his victorious grin under control. 

“No,” Ann pauses to brush back a strand of Koi’s hair, and he sneakily slides a hand towards his cup while his boyfriend is distracted. “I always have full faith in you.”

His fingers close around the rim of Ann’s cup and Koi pulls it out of his grasp. The other man barely notices, just tipsy enough to keep his eyes fixated on Koi. He takes a cautious sip from it before scrunching his face at the taste. Ann lets out an amused huff at Koi’s misfortune, and he shoots him a playful glare. 

“

Maker, 

what drink is this?” The liquor leaves an overwhelmingly sweet taste in Koi’s mouth, and he dumps the offending drink down the sink. Ann walks around the bar to join Koi behind it, snickering as he washes out his mouth.

“It’s an experimental drink, I guess,” Ann’s shoulders are thoroughly shaking with the effort of trying not to laugh out loud. “You don’t like it?”

“I think this might be the only drink of yours that I actually hate.” Koi leans his head back as Ann wraps his arms around his waist, pulling him flush against his body. His head drops to Koi’s shoulder, and he sways them gently as the music on the jukebox changes. Koi wipes away a stray droplet of water from his mouth as Ann’s lekku curls lovingly over his clavicle.

“We dancing?” The mood has suddenly shifted into something softer, more romantic, and Koi feels slightly out of place. Ann only hums into his shoulder, oblivious to his internal struggle. 

“Up to you, 

eswo.”

 

Koi sighs and leans fully into the man behind him. “You know I have two left feet. I’m not suited for slow dancing.” 

Ann hums and the hold around his waist gets tighter. “I disagree. You’re one of the best I’ve ever danced with.”

“Have you danced with many people?” Koi’s question is said jokingly, but there’s a trace of insecurity intertwined with his words. 

“A few,” Ann says quietly. “None as handsome as you, though.” 

The red-hot blush in Koi’s cheeks is impossible to hide, and he tries to play it off as an alcohol flush. “I bet you say that to all the boys, huh?”

Abruptly, he’s spun around to face Ann, and a big hand slides up to hold his face. “Only you, Koi.” 

His tone is so genuine and full of truth, that Koi doesn’t know how to respond. He attempts to laugh it off, but Ann doesn’t let him. “You know that, right? Only you. It’ll only ever be you.” 


This sounds an awful lot like an “I love you,” 

Koi wants to say, but he restrains himself. “You’re drunk,” he says instead.

“Maybe.” Ann shrugs his shoulders, but the heavy hand on his waist never moves. “Does it make what I say less true?”

There’s a moment of silence as Koi takes in his words. “I guess not,” he says eventually. A thumb brushes over his heated cheek, and Koi’s eyes flutter close at the touch. He feels Ann kiss his hairline, then his cheekbone, and finally the corner of his lips. 

“Let’s go upstairs, 

eswo. 

It’s late.” 

Koi follows Ann upstairs, with the cloth still haphazardly slung over his shoulder. The jukebox keeps playing its smooth tunes. The unfinished cups are still stacked beside the sink. 

Hand in hand with his boyfriend, Koi couldn’t care less about any of those things."

Hey, I say, with the hope that you will teach me what I’m looking for.When I turned my back to you, you raised your claymore and brought the fire. Every Abyss Mage burned to ash. You kept my back to you, but not once did you let harm come to me, swinging and slashing and striking like a knight out of memory.When I came back from my visit to Stormterror’s Lair – each and every time, truthfully – you turned to face me. The crest of your smile touched my cheek and now keeps the warmth with me, a moment I can feel becoming memory.Every time I feel a shove pushing me toward the Cathedral, and there’s a huff of laughter behind me, an urging to step forward and put myself in the hands of the believers – that’s your belief.Every time I imagine my hand locking around your wrist when you shake me awake, that’s my desire. When there’s a song in my throat and a tempo dancing along my body, your silence falling into mine as we resemble each other – that’s your belief. Hey, you say, with the intention of dragging me out of the past, planting me right in the present.When you settled against my shoulder, you dropped your temple to the crown of my head and handed me your weight. Though I huffed and puffed and complained, you trusted me to keep you aloft. With the wind at our backs, we became weightless; with your belief in my pocket, the moment crystallised.When I returned to Angel’s Share for the umpteenth time – every day, let’s not lie – you raised your hand in greeting. I kept my true feelings sealed behind my lips, things I could not name; nevertheless, you treated me just the same, passing me drinks and rolling your eyes at my stories.Every time your naked fingers brush my palm and there’s an electricity, I’m not sure what to call this. There’s a beloved, well-worn, and unextinguished love in my heart, always yearning for the one I see in the mirror.Every time I blow air across the bridge of your nose, you scowl, failing to hide the quirk in your mouth. You’re not sure what to call this. There’s a beloved, well-worn, and unrepaired crack in your heart, a hurt you will possess for the rest of your life.There are some things that cannot be repaired. There are some pains that make us, that shape us, become the foundation of the people we are still becoming.I won’t ever try to fix you. You won’t ever tell me I’m more than enough. You won’t lie to me.Every time you turn to face me, the wind will welcome you home. Every time you turn your back to Mondstadt, the breeze will be there to guide your journey wherever you may go.When you come back to me, say  Hey, like you mean to tell me the flighty bard is enough.When I put my hands on you, framing your arms and smiling up at you, let me say  Hey:   Hey,  with the intention of showing you formless love can take across centuries, encapsulated in a syllable. Hey, I tell you.You smirk at me and you say,  Hey yourself. Incomprehensibly everything."

Nekomaru always found sports his comfort, if he was feeling down he would go outside or pick up a ball. He he couldn't do that ,he would curl up into himself.  Watching his team win at a tournament made him feel useless, even if he was the one that trained his friends.Sighing ,he took a spoon full of soup an out it in his mouth.  ""Mmhh!!"" And let out a muffled shout, unaware of how hot the soup is,  he quickly swallowed and waved his hands to himself.  The nurse, Miss. Ayame, quickly opened a bottle of water.   Should have seen it was steaming.Miss. Ayame was like his seconds mother while his parents were away.  Nekomaru has been calling her 'mom' since he was ten, and she started taking care of him while he was five, since she was 20.   Nekomaru took the remote and flipped through the channels,  stopping once he's seen a familiar face.  Teruteru Hanamura, he was 14 years old, a year younger than him, but he's had his celebrity crush on him since forever. ""What're we watching?"" She placed the trey in his bed-side table incase it falls and burns him.  ""Just the Hanamura diner."" ""Again?""  She chuckled, but she felt bitter, jealous. ""Yep.. But I'm watching mostly for Teruteru."" Nekomarus face went red as he watched the confident smirk across the boys face.  Ayame huffled ,sweeping her blonde hair behind her shoulder and making her way to the door. However Nekomaru was too invested in the show to notice the jealousy and bitterness in her eyes.He was proud of his team though. Living his dream for him.   Though he did feel useless and embarressed to be in a hospital bed, he still cared about his team to hell and back.  If it wasn't for throwing up gallon of blood through his mouth and through his nose in the morning maybe he would have participated in the fun.   ""Nekomaru?""  ""Yeah?""

Aziraphale, however, is determined to wake his demon up for breakfast...Just some soft, domestic fluff, folks...",English,964,1/1,1,14,1,49,"In general, Crowley wasn’t a fan of the cold season. After all, he was essentially part reptile, making him at least partly poikilothermic. And there was a part of him that reminded him every winter that it would be so much nicer to just stay in bed, to burrow under a ton of blankets and only come out again once the warmth was returning to the outside world.Sharing a cottage with an angel, however, and having a general interest in spending as much time with said angel as he possibly could was going rather against that partial instinct of his serpentine nature. Still, he usually tended to sleep in, and especially during winter time, he wasn’t easily coaxed out of bed in the morning and would happily laze around and take naps (preferably with his head in his angel’s lap) over the day.Aziraphale, on the other hand, never needed much sleep to begin with. He was generally the one who got up earlier and made breakfast, especially during winter, and it wasn’t any different this morning. The angel had been humming to himself happily, puttering away in the kitchen downstairs, preparing toast and eggs, tea for himself and coffee for Crowley, and when he looked outside, he was delighted to see that the winter seemed to be in its final stages and spring seemed determined to finally arrive with full force. Nature was awakening, with the first flowers tentatively raising their heads in the garden, accompanied by patches of fresh green. The angel smiled at the sight and listened to the birds’ chirping outside for a moment, and he was still smiling when he lay the table for Crowley and himself. Now, he only needed to coax his demon out of bed to join him for breakfast.When Aziraphale came back into the bedroom, he wasn’t all that surprised to find Crowley still asleep, despite the fact that it was already past ten. The demon had curled up in the bed, with his back towards Aziraphale. Usually, he would all but burrow underneath the blankets, but at this point, he had apparently wrapped them into a messy pile and was hugging them in very much the same way he would, at times, hug Aziraphale and cling to him when they were sharing the bed at night. The angel smiled fondly. Due to his current sleeping position, the top of Crowley’s black silk pyjama had slipped up a bit, exposing a strip of bare skin on his lower back.Still smiling, Aziraphale closed the distance and sat down on the edge of the bed. He reached out and gently ran his fingers through the demon’s red hair. Crowley grunted slightly, but he didn’t quite wake up yet.“Good morning, darling…Come on, rise and shine…”“Hnnf…gnn…”, came the demon’s sleep-addled reply.Aziraphale chuckled and changed tactics, slowly trailing his fingertips across the exposed skin on his partner’s back, causing a slight shiver to run through him. Aziraphale was rather amazed to see the brief, soft ripple of dark scales across pale skin. This time, the touch elicited a sigh rather than a grunt, but Crowley still refused to actually turn around and wake up properly.“If you refuse to wake up and come downstairs for breakfast with me, I’m going to steal your blanket”, the angel threatened in a light tone and began to gently pull at said blanket.Crowley just clung to it a little more possessively than before and grumbled. “Could j’sss’ss well be th’ blanket insss’ead…”, he muttered.“What was that, my dear?”The demon huffed and finally did turn around. He looked up at the angel, blinking very slowly, his eyes completely yellow and still somewhat unfocused. “I sssaid you could just ass well be my blanket inssstead…”Aziraphale chuckled. “Oh, I see…Well, I suppose I was for the better part of last night. Come on now, Crowley, it’s past ten. Breakfast time. Rise and shine, sleeping beauty…”“Oi! Jusst because you don’t value a good night’s sleep, doesn’t mean…”“I even made coffee…The way you like it…”For a brief moment, the demon just stared at him. Then, he chuckled as well. “Alright, alright, fine…C’mere then, kiss me…and…maybe some morning cuddles before breakfast, eh?”Aziraphale smiled brightly and already moved to slip into bed beside Crowley once again. “How could I ever resist such a temptation? But I insist that we will have breakfast afterwards…”Crowley smiled back at him. “Sure thing, Angel. Now, come here…”And with that, he pulled his angel in for a kiss. He might not be all that fond of the cold season in general, but this was definitely worth waking up for. Something he could definitely get used to. He happily traded the blanket for an armful of angel to kiss and to snuggle up to. As for Aziraphale, he was more than happy for some extra cuddles and kisses before breakfast. After all, who cared if their breakfast turned into brunch? They had all the time in the world. Humans, Aziraphale mused, thought a lot about Heaven as the perfect place, but he was an angel and he knew better. This, here, was true Heaven. As it was meant to be. A place on Earth, with the one being that he loved the most.He had no idea that Crowley entertained very similar thoughts in that very same moment. This was, without any doubt, his own personal paradise, with his own personal piece of Heaven, his angel…the best piece of Heaven, no doubt, the best angel She had ever created. Aziraphale just blushed and kissed him again, and it was only in that moment that Crowley realised that he’d actually said that out loud."

Gritting her teeth, she managed to escape the clutches of their seemingly-soundproof bedroom. Progress.Slowly, the witch staggered along the hallway, still using the wall as a crutch of sorts.

Miraculously, she was able to safely lower herself to the ground, panting as placed a hand over her enlarged abdomen.She spent the next few minutes with her eyes squeezed shut, praying for the whole thing to be over. However, it only seemed to get worse as the next contraction literally made her shriek in agony.Luckily, her cries did not go unnoticed this time as the next thing she knew Kurt was kneeling in front of her, clutching her hands and telling her to breathe.“Hank!!”Unfortunately, the scientist couldn’t hear a thing from his lab. Kurt felt anger boil inside of him.“HANK!!!

She pushed even harder than she had before despite the increasing pain spreading through her body. Eventually, the baby made its way out of Wanda’s body, the latter screaming in agony as it did.After the pain subsided, Wanda opened her eyes to see Kurt tenderly cradling their child.“Congratulations meine liebe, it’s a girl.”Carefully, he handed his lover the infant, who then yawned and opened her eyes.“Wow,” Wanda chuckled, admiring her daughter’s cyan irises. “She's beautiful.”“I agree.

Shade wrapped his arms around Fed’s neck gently, as Fed put his hands on Shade’s hips, pulling him closer.This went on for around ten minutes before Fed gently bit Shade’s lower lip, asking for entrance, Shade slightly parted his lips, allowing Fed to turn the kiss into a french kiss.Fed pushed Shade against the wall completely, at an attempt to deepen the kiss, Shade wrapped his legs around Fed’s waist.Fed pulled away from the kiss to catch his breath, a thin string of saliva(? probably goo tbh) connecting the two before splitting in two rather quickly.After he caught his breath Fed wiped it off of his chin and Shade’s. “I know we’ve never went past this but do you wanna take this further if that’s okay? I understand if you aren’t ready though.” He asked, smiling. Shade smiled back, he appreciated Fed asking before doing anything else. “Yeah, i’m cool with that.”""You know, I’ve been wanting to do this with you for quite a while."" Fed’s paws traveled down Shade's sides, gently rubbing them. Shade smirked. “Oh really now? Why wouldn’t you just ask me, Love?”“hm, I dunno, I guess I was just waiting for you to make the first move relating to that.” Fed stopped rubbing his sides, and lowered himself onto his knees, moving a tuft of fur on Shade’s lower region, revealing his member.Shade’s smirk went to a slightly embarrassed expression, the two never really did anything like this, it was new. Fed placed his paws on Shade’s shaft, gently stroking it. “Mm.. Fed-” he moaned out quietly.“Enjoying yourself, love?” Fed asked, earning a nod from the other slightly picking up the pace he was stroking his partner’s length at. Shade covered his mouth, as a pathetic attempt to hold back his moans.Eventually Shade uncovered his mouth. “I-I think i’m gonna-“ Fed stopped, looking up at Shade who had a somewhat confused look on his face. “We haven’t even gotten to the fun part of it yet, darling.”"

Big red letters, encased in a red perfect heart.DANNY AND JANETOGETHER FOREVER <3",English,776,1/1,,1,,5,"In the great vast and seemingly never ending forest that surrounded the campfire where our heroes, the many, many so-called survivors of this realm, was a tree. While there were other trees in this forest, this tree was different. When its vast dark branches were cut, it bled a deep red color. And this vibrant red would not fade.The ever curious and bespectacled girl named Claudette discovered this tree. She was known to frequent the expanding forest. Often allowing her curiosity led her to seek out this realm’s unknown flora. After she discovered this, she quickly showed the tree to her companion and fellow wanderer of the woods, Jake. Now, Jake didn’t tell anyone about it. But Claudette soon told her fellow survivor, the energetic athlete, Meg and soon the entirety of the survivor camp knew of the bleeding red tree. It became a nice spectacle for the survivors. Something to help pass their time and take their mind off the real reason for their existence in the Entity’s world.Claudette took samples from the bleeding tree, hoping she could use it as a remedy for the others. Others carved out words or pictures onto its bark as an artistic expression. There were many explicit words expressing their ire for their foes and for the one that brought them here.And some used the tree as a break from the others. Often, they would trek by themselves to look for any more additions to the red tree.Nea, was one such person, as an artist from her previous life, she liked to glance at the cravings on the tree and guess who their creator was. She also wished she could collect the red color and use it for herself for a future project. She doubted she would ever be able to do, the longer she stayed here.That’s when she saw it. It was a big carving that stood in the back of a tree. Big red letters, encased in a perfect red heart.DANNY AND JANETOGETHER FOREVER <3It was too baffling and Nea had too many questions not to gasp out loud. The carving itself was neat and nicely spaced out; despite the childish nature of the words. Like some love sick teenager would carve out.She knew who Jane was, she was a celebrity. She had a popular talk show with so many merch tie-ins. Despite her fame, she was still a considerate teammate in their trials. But who was the other guy?Nea marched back to the campfire and straight towards the Emmy nominated show host sitting peacefully amongst the crowd. “I need you to come with me.” She stated as she pointed to the direction of the red tree.Nea did not want to outright ask her and draw a crowd, but despite her good intentions a few of their survivors got curious and followed them. It was better than just sitting around waiting for their curtain call.The small group came upon the craving.“Who’s Danny?” Was the first question that was asked.They all turned towards the woman in question. Looking for answers.“What?” She frowned at the sudden attention.“How am I supposed to know?” She added, perplexed by the whole issue. “You didn’t carve this?” Ace, the self proclaimed professional gambler, asked while he inspected the cravings. He liked to study his fellow survivors’ handwriting whenever he got the chance, for fun. At least, while he was still trapped here. “Of course not!” She retorted, offended by the accusation. She would never risk getting the red sap underneath her manicured nails.“You have a secret admirer!” Kate, the soulful artist, teased, pointing at the various hearts that ordained the craving. She was getting so much inspiration from this.Jane could only furrow her perfectly shaped brows in thought. As far as she knew, she did not know anyone by that name. But that was not the issue for her at the moment. No, because this carving, its entire baffling presence reminded her of someone. Someone that would do something like this. Something so declarative and attention seeking. Seeking her attention.She glanced around to see if he was around. He often liked to watch her. It was only recently that she found out that he liked to do so in between trials.She saw him peeking at her through the darkness of the woods. His white mask fixated on her. He gave her an enthusiastic wave in return.Of course. She thought plainly. She was often right when it came to him. This would be the way he would reveal his first name to her."

He was leaning back against the headboard, arms at his sides. Hyeongjun couldn't help but stare at his cock, it was really big and veiny.

Hyeongjun's mouth was dry, he wanted that in his mouth, in his ass, he just needed it in him. He took in a shuddering little breath, pulling off his underwear. He was left naked. Hyeongjun scrambled onto the bed and grabbed at the lubricant on the side, pressing fingers inside himself as quickly as he could manage.

He hissed because of the burn as he stretched himself too quickly, and he bucked his hips up with desperate little whimpers. Serim just kept grinning, tilting his head slightly as he watched Hyeongjun.

Hyeongjun moved forwards as quick as he could once he'd prepped himself sufficiently, swallowing as he carefully positioned himself over Serim's dick. Serim caught his hips just as he moved to start dropping himself down, keeping Hyeongjun still with his strength. Hyeongjun's eyes went wide.

""No, don't tease,""

Serim carefully loosened his grip, slowly lowering Hyeongjun down. Hyeongjun tried to fight Serim's hold, but he couldn't do it. Hyeongjun was whining his impatience by the time Serim was halfway in him, because he needed to feel full.

By the time Hyeongjun had taken the whole of him he felt like crying with relief, and he squirmed a little to feel Serim's length inside of him.

""Need you to move."" Hyeongjun whined, and Serim laughed.

""You move."" Serim said. Like an order. Hyeongjun swallowed, staring at him.

""You did hear me?""

Hyeongjun began to fuck himself on Serim's cock.

One of Serim's hands stayed on his hip, and then the other was on his cock, stroking him and thumbing over his head and he could feel the pressure, the warmth on his skin.

Hyeongjun came with a loud cry, clenching around Serim's cock."

She walked to the center of the room where a small wooden box was placed on a pedestal. She opened the box and opened her eyes wide. The ring was not there.“That's impossible,” she muttered.“Is this what you’re looking for ?”Fujiko quickly turned round.“Lupin !” she exclaimed.",English,863,1/1,,,1,5,"Fujiko arrived in front of the vault room. She had nearly finished. She had been planning her move for weeks. She was looking for a ring. It was not the ring itself that was important, but the stone that adorned it.It was a diamond given to Empress Josephine at her wedding to Napoleon. When Josephine died, the diamond had disappeared. It was found a year ago, assemble on a ring and put up for auction. The whole world was talking about it when the auction was won by a powerful business magnate who had made his fortune by creating a new social network. The ring had cost him several million, it had become a historic auction.Fujiko had prepared a plan to be able to appropriate this ring. She had managed to get hired as the businessman's assistant. She had proved indispensable and he could no longer do without her. She had found where the ring was and had eluded security. There was only the door of this vault room left to walk through.In addition to the code she had found, there was a fingerprint sensor and a retinal scanner. She put on contact lenses and stood in front of the scanner. The retina of the businessman was recognized. Then she put on a glove where his fingerprints were and put her hand on the detector. She dialed the code and smiled when the door opened.Everything was going as planned. She pushed the door open and entered the room. She walked to the center of the room where a small wooden box was placed on a pedestal. She opened the box and opened her eyes wide. The ring was not there.“That's impossible,” she muttered.
“Is this what you’re looking for ?”Fujiko quickly turned round.“Lupin !” she exclaimed.He was leaning against the wall, one hand in his pocket and the other holding the ring. Fujiko was angry. How dare he beat her to it and steal the ring. Of course, she had played this trick on him many times before, but that was no excuse. Lupin approached her and smirked. Fujiko had always loved that smirk. But right now, it irritated her.“Beautiful ring. I'm not surprised you like it so much.”He tossed the ring up into the air and caught it.“Give it to me,” she said. “I worked too hard for you to have it.”
“I also worked hard. You could choose other equally beautiful rings.”
“This is the one that I want.”
“I want it too.”She felt like she was acting like a five-year-old, but she did not care. Besides, Lupin was no better than her.“Anyway, it would look much better on me than on you,” she said.
“We’ll see.”He put the ring on his finger to challenge her. He did not show it, but he was having fun with the situation. She approached him and glared at him. They were only a few inches apart. She could feel the warmth of his body.“Lupin, give me the ring.”
“Make me.”Fujiko smirked. Lupin knew that smile, which usually nothing good come of all this. She suddenly grabbed his jacket and snuggled up to him. Lupin had no time to react when she kissed him. It was the kind of kiss that made his head spin and forget everything that was going on around him. He put his arm around her waist and pulled her closer to him. Only Fujiko and her lips on his mattered. He was lost in that kiss and did not feel Fujiko discreetly take the ring from him. She abruptly pulled away from him. Lupin opened his eyes, not understanding what was going on. He saw Fujiko showing him the ring around her ring finger.“Thanks for the ring,” she said happily.
“That’s cheating !”Lupin stamped his foot, feeling stupid for having fallen so easily into her trap. She walked to the door and waved at him.“Bye !”She closed the door behind her. Lupin rushed to the door and pulled it with all his might. Fortunately for him, it was easier to get out of the vault room than to get in. The door opened and he walked out. He looked both ways down the hall. Fujiko had disappeared.“Lupin !”Lupin saw Zenigata running towards him. He’s all I need, he thought. He managed to escape from the property and reach his car, which he had hidden further away. He arrived an hour later at his hideout. He opened the door and saw Fujiko sitting on the couch. He was not surprised to see her. He closed the door and walked over to the couch.“To apologize, I'm inviting you to dinner,” she said. “So no hard feelings ?”Lupin smiled. No matter dirty tricks they might play on each other, he cared too much about her to stay angry.“No hard feelings.”He held out his hand to help her up and she accepted it. They went out to dinner and for once Lupin would not try anything to get the ring back. After all, he had the most precious treasure by his side.

The bell struck the first of twelve chimes, and everyone froze.
The boys that had fought with more vigor than ever stared with wide eyes, Nesta stopped grinning, Ritsuka gasped and momentarily ceased her struggle.
There it was, the Grimoire’s light. It came from within her, blinding everyone. Pained groans could be heard as light came from her in waves, instantly burning the weakest Vampires around. And with each bell’s dong, the light grew in intensity and strength, until the last chime burned even Nesta, whose body turned to ashes as he screamed in agonising pain.
As soon as the bell got quiet again, the light went back inside Ritsuka, who slid down to the ground with an exhausted sigh.“Ritsuka!” Rem gasped, dashing immediately to her side. “Are you alright?”
She smiled weakly at him, her breath ragged from exertion. “Y-yeah… Just need a break…”Lindo looked around for his father with wide eyes, afraid that he would - once again - come back to life.
Yet thankfully, he did not.Once they realised that all the Vampires were, in fact, completely gone, the boys relaxed a little and lowered their guards before starting to inspect the damage. Nothing much had stayed intact, even the two statues near where Nesta had been were completely charred.As they congratulated each other for the win and checked for any wounds, marvelling at what Ritsuka had done, two figures, far enough not be seen but close enough to have been able to witnessed what had happened, glared at each other from opposite sides.
“So the Grimoire was never an Artifact…” the male groaned, putting a round green pendant back under his shirt.
“It was just raw power.” The female scowled, playing absent-minded with a thick ring on her middle finger.
“Gotta search somewhere else…”
The male disappeared first with an irritated huff, the female following suit - but not after her eyes lingered a few moments more on one of the boys’ back.“We need to return, I really need a bath.” Urie complained, scrunching his nose slightly as the scent of blood and sweat reached his nose - they had all fought harshly that night, after all.
“What, already? C’mon, this is exactly what a warrior should smell like, flower boy!” Mage grinned, raising his arm.
The Incubus glared at him and threw back a snark reply, and that caused the two Demons to start another one of their petty arguments.
Shiki chuckled at the scene, but then blinked and turned his head to look back, momentarily distracted from the verbal fight. He had suddenly felt watched for a moment… *** It happened not too much time after that huge fight.
Ritsuka and Rem professed their love for each other, but then parted ways.
She would stay in the Human World with her family and continue her studies, not to mention that she needed to start training the power that she had gained by unconsciously absorbing the Grimoire that night.
Lindo and Azuna, who had actually started dating, where in charge of tutoring her, while Maria taught her some more English skills that she would need for her upcoming exams.Rem, Urie and Mage had gone back to Gehenna, the Arlond heir barely surviving the rage that his father had poured over him once he found out that they had been unable to obtain the Grimoire.Roen had disappeared, and nobody knowing where he had gone to.And Shiki…
Having helped with preventing the Grimoire’s power to fall in the Vampires’ hands had convinced the Angels to give him a second chance, though for now he was just going to lay low and do some easy jobs, mostly patrolling for any stray Vampire that might get too hungry.
It was boring, but for once, he welcomed the change. The only thing that stayed the same were his pitch-black wings and his powers.It happened on a tranquil day.
Roen had been going on with his daily tasks by searching books and ancient knowledge in search of a different power to free his master.
He was truly starting to get irritated and had just thrown aside another useless tome, when he felt it.
Roen froze and looked over to the dark, peaceful room where He was.
He stood up from his desk with a strangled gasp, his eyes widening as he felt ripples of power - a very known power - come from the closed door.
He felt a sound coming from there, and after another moment he jolted towards the room.
Roen took a moment to compose himself even though his heart was pounding hard, and carefully opened the door.
The white, usually sealed book that was in the middle of the room was lit by the library’s light: its pages were turning on their own furiously fast.
And then, the pages suddenly stopped, showing the middle of the book: both pages were black.
And from that blackness, a shadow started to rise - just as quickly as Roen’s tears in his eyes.
The Cerberus fell to one knee and bowed.
“Welcome back, Makiss-sama.” He greeted, barely able to keep his voice steady."

So now after having to deal with too many people you didn't account for, you find yourself infront of your Captains office, unsure if you should knock or not. He did say that his office is always open for you and whatever you need, but you couldn't help feel a bit silly. You knocked anyway, before you spiralled even more into your head. After hearing your Captains invite to come inside, you opened the door and let yourself inside. Mactavish sat at his desk filling out some papers. He looked up after a few moments of silence ""you need anything?"" ""I... ye.. no, sorry, i should..."" you turned to leave again, tho he called you back. ""Stay! Sit!"" It wasn't fully his Captain ordering, but it was close. So you moved and sit down, staring down at your hands. ""Talk to me, what's going on"" you shrugged ""don't know, it just all didn't... i couldn't..."" you sighed ""i don't even know why I'm here, it's stupid, i should just go back to my room, sorry to bother you, sir"" you moved again ""i told you to stay!"" He said firmly ""and you're no bother, now slowly, what's the issue?"" Taking a deep breath you tried to somehow explain, how the day went sideways and how that's now stuck in your brain and making you feel itchy and you can't seem to do anything about it. "".. i know you probably have better things to do than to listen to this, I'm sorry Cap"" he shakes his head ""nothing to be sorry about, stuff like that happens"" he looks at you for a second, before smirking ""come here"" he beckoned. You stand up slightly confused, but moving to stand next to him anyway. ""you need out you pretty little head, huh?"" You nod. ""Kneel"" ""What?"" You stammer, staring at him. ""That's why you came to me right? Because you know that i know what you'd need"" ""i.. maybe.."" ""then, kneel, darling"" you nod and slowly kneel down next to him, keeping your eyes on him at all times. He pushes away from the desk a little to make space and gestures for you to take that place. After being seated under there, he scoots closer again. ""Now, here's what's gonna happen, i need to finish all this and you will stay down there and keep my dick in your mouth til I'm done and not think about a single thing, okay?"" You nod, it's not the first time, something like this happened, tho usually it's in one of your private rooms and not his office, but it's fine, he knows what he's doing, right? So, the moment he got his still soft dick out, you move to take it into your mouth, shifting a bit to get a more comfortable position and lean your head against his thigh. A hand comes down and pets your head. ""That's it, now just stay like that"" the hand was gone as fast as it was there and then you could hear him start writing again. In the first minutes you couldn't think that it works the way he thought, because you still felt so on edge. ""I can hear you thinking, darling, just focus on the feeling of me, okay"" you gave a light nod, willing to give it a try. So, you try to put your head a bit more on the dick in your mouth, slightly moving your tounge around it, til you hear him clear his throat. ""Don't suck, baby"" whining lightly, but stopping anyway, you went back to trying to just focus on the weight and sensory of the now half hard cock. That paired with the Captain's smell under your nose and the repetitive sounds of him filling papers, did after a little clear your head, going a bit more lax against his leg. If you also dozed off a little, he didn't mention it after he pulled you off a while later."

A smirk formed slowly on Stanley’s face.“GOD, WHY WONT YOU JUST LISTEN” The speakers boomed, pure fear washed over Stanley.“Oh god Stanley- I’m so sorry” The Narrator’s voice filled with fear also. “I dont know what go over me- I- I need some time.” Stanley could hear a door close.Another reset. When Stanley walked out of his office.. no narration, at the two doors.. no narrative, at the Employee Lounge maybe?.. still no sign of The Narrator. Tears slowly rolled down Stanley’s cheeks.‘Why wouldn’t I listen sooner’ ‘Why wouldn’t I just continue the story’ ‘WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY’ One negative thought over another. Stomping towards the cargo lift, knees weak, like he ways about to collapse.As Stanley was about to get on the cargo lift.A crash. It sounded like shelves crashing down. A scream. He ran towards the sound, in the maintenance section. Stanley sprung to action and dashed to the maintenance section. But when he arrived. It wasn’t the maintenance section anymore. It was an office. Narrator trying to hold a shelf from crashing down onto him. Books scattered on the floor the titles reading “The Stanley Parable: Zending” “The Stanley Parable: Freedom Ending” (so on and so forth). Stanley sprinted towards Narrator helping him push the shelf back into its place.The Narrator collapsed on his knees, panting, gasping for air, and then he spoke.“Stanley-?” Narrator lifted his head to face Stanley. He slowly got up and hugged Stanley, sobbing into his shirt. Stanley hugged the shorter man to comfort him. Narrator tilted his head upwards, gazing into Stanley’s dark eyes “Oh Stanley! I-I’m so sorry- I’m truly sorry I-“ Stanley finished his sentence with a kiss.[I was waiting to do that for forever] Stanley signed, Narrator’s face red like a cherry. “I didn’t know you felt like that~” The Narrator purred. [How couldn’t anyone resist your voice?] “Fair.” And then then they kissed again.Narrator pulled away “We should take it slow right now darling.” Stanley nodded “Come on let’s rest..” Pulling Stanley to a couch and materializing a blanket. It was soft and comfortable. Stanley cuddled up with the Narrator and they drifted off to sleep together.When Stanley awoke the Narrator was gone. Frantically searching for him, bursting the door open. The hallway wasn't there anymore. It was instead replaced with a living room. Rustic and sorta Vintage 80’s-ish. A heavenly smell coming from the next room over. Stanley exited the Narrator’s office into the living room and then into the next room over. It was a kitchen. Stanley glanced around   the kitchen, same vibe as the living room.“Oh Stanley! You’re finally awake!” The Narrator was in an apron with a floral pattern, absolutely adorable. [Oh there you are, I was looking for you.] “Oh sorry darling but I had to cook breakfast” The Narrator revealed a stack of waffles drizzled with maple and chocolate syrup. God it looked so good.“We also have bacon on the stov- THE BACON.” Narrator ran to the stovetop and turning it off. Stanley chuckled a little bit. Narrator bought a plate of perfectly fried bacon, little pricks of sweat on his forehead (Stanley wiped it off of course). “Good news I saved the bacon!” The Narrator said proudly. Stanley took his fork and took a piece, the Narrator nervously watching. [It’s absolutely amazing!]"

The spaz kid's own incessant noise easily rivaled South Park's cricket population, and Kyle just kept joking with Stan about the evening's events rather loudly. But it didn't matter that much, now with Tweek and Kyle back home. Alone on the snowy pave ways were now Stan and Chef. With the louder quiet of the crickets being the only background sound, Stan found his thoughts revving up swiftly. As with most kids his age, Stan's filter was utterly non-existent. So his questions about the events that unfolded that evening simply spewed out.""Hey, Chef?""""Yes, children?""""Are you gonna be able to return those plane tickets?"" Chef appeared a bit frazzled, having not thought about something like this happening in the midst of his earlier panic.""I... the flight is in 5 hours. I don't think I'd be able to.""""Oh, shit dude!"" Stan exclaimed. ""Those tickets must've been expensive... maybe tomorrow Kyle, Cartman, Tweek, and I can try to come up with a plan to earn that money back!"" He added, hoping to soften the blow. Stan knew how little teachers and especially cafeteria staff got paid... and that was 4 plane tickets to the other side of the world! ""Or at the least, you could use a few sick days and go to Thailand with some friends.""""I wish I could, but I wouldn't have the money for a return flight. And don't worry about paying me back. That's not something you children should be worried about."" There was a pause in the conversation. The crickets were fighting for dominance over a landscape of sounds again. A rigid breeze slapped the younger across the face, causing Stan to push his hat further down upon his head. In moments like these, he was jealous of Kyle's big, floppy hat. Another question entered his mind as he watched his breath linger in the nighttime sky. It was a logical next step to take.""Hey, Chef...?"" Chef nodded rather than responding, eyes trailing down to the shorter. ""Why did you do that? Even if you thought we did something so horrible?""""Well um... everybody makes mistakes right!""""Chef... you thought we murdered and raped Ms. Choksondik. Two of the most horrific things ever! And instead of calling the cops or at least leaving us to our own devices, you intervened and tried to aid in our escape. You do realize that's not something the average person would do in that situation, much less just a guy we know from school. Sure you help us but... hell I'm not sure if most of our parents woulda have done what you did!"" Chef sighed, his expression falling flat. A beat passed as he considered the right thing to say.""I don't know. I guess something just compelled me to protect you, children. Maybe you just mean a lot to me... and maybe that means I'd do anything for you, even if I probably shouldn't. I know I really shouldn't care about you this much but-"" Chef was cut off suddenly as he felt a pressure wrap around his leg. Looking down in surprise, he realized it was Stan giving him a hug.""You mean a lot to me to Chef."" Jerome often felt love, but it came in huge, earth-shattering waves of passion and fury. It was the kind of love that swept one off their feet and face-first into the pavement. It was a kind of love that hurt just as much as it soothed. But for the first time in quite some time, he rediscovered another kind that was gentle and warm. It embraced one with no regrets and blatant honesty. And for someone that was numb to the heat of the love he was used to provided, he was still so ambushed by whatever this was... He needed to protect these kids. The part of him that felt as if being a school cafeteria chef was wasting his life away had up and died. He could protect these kids! If he could just do that, then maybe what he's spent the latter half of his life doing would be worth it.It was then he remembered the point of actually standing outside. The two walked a little further before arriving at Stan's house. ""You should go get some rest, it's been a long day.""""I will!""""And I don't want to hear any more about you children committing felonies you got that?""""Yes, Chef!"" Stan approached his door but turned around before opening it. ""And um... thank you again... for everything.""""No problem... good night.""""Night Chef!"" Stan finally went inside and Chef breathed a sigh of relief. It was over. Geez as much as he did care for the children they always found a way to get into the most insane situations possible, how did they do it? Kids weren't like that back in his day... he supposed times were changing. As Jerome turned around to walk home, he heard the door open again. ""Hey Chef, what's for lunch tomorrow?""""Hm... I think it'll be Salisbury steak day.""""Dude sweet!"" The door closed once more....Now he could go home. At that moment he remembered he didn't have ingredients for Salisbury steak day, but he could deal with that in the morning."

After all, Kitty had never been left without a partner at any ball. Frustrations over her desire to fit in with society’s expectations of her aside, what made her suffer most was the loss of her dearest Lydia, first to Brighton and then to Wickham, that had left her all alone, like a house without laughter, a shadow without a body.Being one of the two remaining homebound daughters has its perks though. With household expenses freed up, Mr Bennet procured tickets for a recital of Schubert’s D 157 and while Kitty’s ears delighted in hearing the maestro’s experimentations with harmonic progressions and the fleeting traces of Beethoven, she could only trust Mary to be Mary.Ever since that fateful evening, the family’s most prodigious daughter had been thundering away the E Major scale of which the sonata began in, hoping to unearth its fourth movement. Kitty thought that the joyous ruptures within its third had already given the piece a finale-like character but the self-appointed music scholar insisted that sonatas must cycle back to the tonic. Ending with the rather curious B major must thereby mean that D 157 is incomplete. Sick of the cacophonous din made by Mary’s inelegant hammering of the pianoforte, Kitty slid away to Meryton, lost in thoughts about the similarities she shared with Schubert’s so-called missing movement.Kitty was having a good enough time fleeting through florists and apothecaries until the weather appeared to have caught on to Mary’s influence. The rain quickly turned into a storm. With nowhere else to go, Kitty found herself in a part of town she had never seen before.Lost and disorientated, Kitty thought her eyes were playing tricks on her when she first spotted a cat with a red ribbon beckoning at her. She blinked. It was now joined by another collared companion. Curious about how they remained elegantly poised with one paw raised, Kitty inched towards them for a closer inspection. Aside from being made of clay, they were followed by more feline friends, lined curiously against the honey-tinted walls. Tracing the odd litter until she came across its final member waving at her from the precipice of an open door, Kitty floundered into a bewildering sight.The red, white and blue vases that sat atop their fireplace had never meant much to Kitty even though Mrs Bennet protected them fiercely, claiming that they were heirlooms that were worth hundreds. But face to face with shelves upon shelves of those porcelain wares with their intricate floral prints and geometrical shapes, something sparked within Kitty. Enthralled by everything, Kitty toyed around with a teacup she picked until it slipped from her hands and chipped.Now Catherine Bennet had seen her fair share of charming, red-coated soldiers but right before her was the sharpest looking man she had ever seen. His face was precisely carved, almost defiantly, with clean and keen lines. Most impressive however was his skin. The shade of bottled light and naturally sun-loved, it set her heart aglow.Startled by the sound, the handsome youth turned around and Kitty panicked.Catherine Bennet became tongue tied. It wasn’t because she was at a loss for words, for she was bursting with excuses to make for herself. Rather, Kitty wasn’t sure about how her thoughts could reach him for even though he was dressed no different from the lads she regularly danced with, there was an alienesque quality to the man before her. Kitty grunted awkwardly until he broke the silence.“Do not worry about that, my lady.”Kitty’s mind twisted. She didn’t know what she was expecting but those were not the words she thought she would hear. It didn’t help that they were also delivered in a manner most crisp, much unlike those who had travelled from afar to seek fortune within these isles.“I’m sorry,” said Kitty eventually. “They must be expensive.”The youth laughed.“They do fetch quite a handsome sum…”“I am doubly sorry then. Papa will make it up to you at once.”“There’s absolutely no need to worry. I have plenty more of those. My father brought hundreds of them with him when he first voyaged here. We bring them out to the auction houses every now and then when we’re in want of money.”“You’re not from here then?”“Well, I’ve never been anywhere else before so I’d say that I’m as much from here as you are.”Kitty was ashamed of herself for assuming that he would be foreign by virtue of his countenance alone.“And… what about those cats?”“A most beautiful creature, with milky white skin once came to me in a dream. She told me to sculpt her likeness into clay and good fortune would follow and so I did,” said the youth with a smirk.Kitty flushed. Desperate to hide her embarrassment, she crouched over and picked up the shattered teacup frantically.“Now, I really mustn’t make things difficult for you.”“You can help me mend it if you like?” offered the craftsman as he led Kitty to his desk and retrieved from its drawers lacquered resin and powdered gold.Comforted by the strange harmony offered by the mismatched teacups that sat around them, Kitty relented. As they patiently glued the fragments together, stories about how she forced herself to laugh at every trifler and how his father made him hide behind walls to learn and master the so-called acceptable diction flowed smoothly between them until they were done.“The gold… It stands out…”“Making it exactly what it is,” said the youth. “Seemingly imperfect, but worthy of love and belonging nonetheless.”Catherine Bennet admired the teacup with its cracks mended but aggrandized by gold and smiled. No longer plagued by the disease to please, she realised that she could trust herself to just be Kitty."

Three months later...

 
“Ay,” Mickey lifted his head from Ian's chest and looked at him with one eyebrow raised. ""You never told me what you call your dick."" He grinned.

Ian laughed and continued to slowly stroke Mickey's arm that was wrapped around his stomach. ""What do you think I call it?""

""I don't know. Maybe magic sword?"" Mickey propped himself up on Ian's chest to sit up. ""Or wait, better yet the Destroyer.""

Ian laughed even louder than before. ""You're crazy.""

""Or-""

""Okay, before you come up with any more stupid names, I'll call him Jaro, okay?"" Ian cut Mickey off.

""Jaro?"" Mickey repeated questioningly.

""Yeah, don't laugh, but I used to be a real gamer freak. Played Star Wars games on the Playstation all the time.""

“Shit, man,” Mickey looked at Ian and couldn’t help but smile from one ear to the other.


His boyfriend used to be a total geek. Maybe he still was. There was still so much they didn't know about each other.




Boyfriend

. That still sounded weird, even in Mickey’s head.

They had been together for a little over three months now and even though they had had the boyfriend talk a while back, Mickey still couldn’t believe Ian was really his.

“Hey! I said don’t laugh.” Ian hid his face behind his hands and rolled onto his side.

“Ay, I think it’s… I don’t know, cute.” Mickey grabbed his shoulders and made Ian roll back, facing him again. “But why Jaro, though?”



“Ughh,” Ian sighed.

“Come on, tell me.”

“Okay,” Ian scooted up on the bed and sat on his knees opposite Mickey. They were both completely naked and Mickey couldn’t help but admire Ian from head to toe. It was late, after midnight and the moon shone his faint light through Mickey’s window, bathing them in a silvery glow.

Mickey felt like that was all he had been doing in the past three months. Looking at Ian. But Ian was just so beautiful. And it had become Mickey’s favorite pastime.

“Have you ever heard of Cal Kestis?” Ian asked, interrupting Mickey's thoughts.

“Nope.” Mickey shook his head.

“Okay,” Ian said, dragging out each letter. “But you know what Star Wars is, right?”

“I mean I’ve heard of it. But I’ve never seen the movies.""



“What???” Ian looked at him in complete and utter shock.

Mickey shook his head again and shrugged.

“But why? I mean how? Where?” Ian was obviously not able to form a coherent sentence.



“Don’t get your panties in a twitch.” Mickey chuckled. “I’ve been busy, you know? Working and shit. Taking care of my family.”



“No, I mean, yeah, I know that. But come on, Mick. It’s Star Wars.”

“Calm down, Gallagher.” Mickey leaned forward and reached for Ian’s cock. “Just tell me why you named those fuckin' glorious nine inches Jaro, will you?”

“I’m just in shock, that’s all.” Ian said, his voice a little shaky because of the way Mickey was starting to stroke his dick.

“I know just the thing to make you snap out of it.” Mickey whispered with a sly smile.

“So, in Star Wars there’s this one Jedi, his name’s Cal Kestis and he, I guess, he kinda looks like me.” Ian went on, trying to keep his breathing steady and his voice from breaking.



“Red hair, big dick?” Mickey chuckled against Ian’s skin while he planted soft kisses on his collarbone, his hand still moving up and down Ian’s cock.

“Haha.” Ian said, breathing heavier now. “Well, and Cal's got a master you could say, and his name’s Jaro Tapal.”

“Ohhh, so you named your dick after a Jedi Master. I see.” Mickey hummed, picking up the pace. 

“Guess I did.” Ian moaned, closing his eyes.  “Fuuuuck, Mickey. So good.” 

“I guess you could only call it megalomania if it wasn't justified.” Mickey grinned against Ian’s warm skin. “Let me take care of the Master then,” Mickey chuckled and pushed Ian back on the bed, making himself at home between Ian’s legs. “You’re a fuckin’ geek, you know that?” He smiled up at his boyfriend before he swallowed all of Ian’s nine inches."

The trial he had been summoned to had been a rough one, of course his sister was in it and of course she had managed to teach the other survivors her signature move of stabbing him in the shoulder with a glass shard.It's not like he truly minded, the entity always patches up the killers if one of the more bold survivours managed to get a hit on them. He had ended up back in his room, even if it wasn't actually his he had managed to scavenge the entity made houses for supplies. A ratty mattress on the floor, with a black torn sheet. He didn't originally have a blanket, but Anna had gifted him one sometime when he was new to all of this.He walked over to his bed and sat down, sighing, he knew what he needed to do to calm the fiery rage that consumed him. He pulled out his spare knife from under his pillow. One that had never touched anyone else's skin, it's blade glinting in the orange street light filtering through the dirty window. He rolled up his jumpsuit sleeve, moving the blade onto his skin, pushing hard against his wrist, and tearing the blade across fast and hard, leaving a weeping wound in its place. He moved to do another but stopped himself.
He could feel eyes on him, but from where. He pulled his mask back on and rolled his sleeve back down, standing up to look around. His door was closed so that only left the windows overlooking the street. Turning around quickly He noticed movement under the left most window and a ghost like black tendril floating a few feet from the pane.He stalked towards it making no sound, and threw open the damaged window, grabbing into the air to try and snatch whatever or whoever was out there. It took a second but his hands eventually closed on what felt like leather and cotton. Yanking upwards and towards himself he pulled a startled ghostface up over the window sil and into his room. He scoffed ""the ghostface, spying on me?"" He dropped him unceremoniously onto the floor and shut the window, stomping down hard on one of the man's tendrils to keep him from running off, the entire time the smaller man complaining about how rough michael was being.""You know you could've just asked me to come in, instead of being an ass about it right?"" Jed whined, standing up to brush himself off. Michael didn't respond, just frowned deeply behind his mask. Jed looked up to the taller man, taking in the sight, his mask hiding the wicked grin.Jed still bound by a tendril to michael walked around the bigger man, ""I wasn't spying on you or stalking you or whatever, I got wind that there was some rooms with like, actual beds and I don't exactly have my own space""Michael just tilted his head curiously at him, wondering why this man insisted in speaking so much. He just wanted him to shut up. He couldn't stand the grating voice.Jed continued to talk, trying to rationalize to Michael about why he was there, not realizing that while he was talking Michael and lifted his boot off of the tendril and had started slowly walking towards him, cornering the smaller man without him noticing.""Anyways I thought I could just crash here, if that's cool with you. Not like you could say otherwise anyways."" Jed continued on Michael letting him finish his sentence before he moved quick as a whip, securing it around the smaller man's neck before he could react.
He lifted him up off the ground, jed left kicking and clawing at Michael's arms. He waited to hear that signature noise of a choked gurgling, or for a true fight, but instead he was met with a quiet moan. One that immediately set michael on edge in the best way. Really? He tilted his head at the other man carrying him by the neck over to the bed and dropped the smaller man onto it.He knew what he wanted. No, Needed, to do. Moving down to get in the smallers level he grabbed his knife from his jumpsuit pocket and put it to the black clad man's chest, motioning for him to take off the God awful cloak."

He was bored, and the pair across from him were quite frankly making him queasy with their will they won’t they bullshit. Their heads were close together, hands intertwined under the table, and they were talking softly. He had swung back on his chair- he was the one with the best view of the end of the aisle, and abruptly swung forward with a gasp.“Guys, I just saw Sirius!”The way they scrambled apart in a panic was well worth the joke.Sirius had never come. The second, was when he happened across them in the bleachers of the quidditch pitch, James completing some homework with Regulus tucked into his side.“You know, I just saw Sirius getting ready to do some flying practice.” Peter said casually. “Had the bludgers out, full kit on and everything.”“No you didn’t,” James tried, “He wouldn’t have practice without me.”“Well, you have been AWOL an awful lot lately Prongs,” Peter shrugged.The pair exchanged a worried look and slid apart, Regulus muttering his apologies and a goodbye, promptly leaving the stands.When Sirius didn’t come, James turned on Peter with a scowl. “Stop doing that!”And Peter couldn’t help but laugh. The third time, though, it hadn’t been a false alarm.He had come into the dorms and found them in more of a compromising position than usual, Regulus straddling James on the sofa, James’ hand in his hair. There was no explaining that away.“Guys!” He hissed.They ignored him, and he closed the door behind him.“Guys!” He said as he neared them. “Guys Sirius is coming upstairs right the fuck now!”“Fuck off, Peter,” James growls back, Regulus taking the break from his lips to kiss down his neck.Peter pales. “No honestly, I’m not kidding. I was just with him.”But it’s too late, and the door creaks open. Peter squeaks and transforms into a rat, scuttling away.James looks past Regulus with wide eyes as Sirius stands in the door, matching expressions of horror.“P-Prongs?” he says.Regulus stills at the sound of his brother's voice, bracing his hand on James’ chest and pulling back to gape at him. “Oh fuck, he wasn’t joking.”“One might say, he was being a Sirius alarm.” James tried to joke, which only led to his boyfriend smacking his chest, Remus snickering in the doorway and Sirius rushing forward to pull his brother by the scuff of the neck off of James’ lap- which, frankly, was not the smartest move on his part.Sirius lets go of Regulus and covers his eyes with a groan. “Buggering fuck are you kidding me? James you better get the fuck out of my sight before I kill you. Regulus I can’t look at you either right now. Dammit, both of you just get out.” he decides.The pair adjust themselves and leave, Remus barely stifling his amusement.Outside and down the corridor, Peter is waiting. “I tried to warn you!” He said.Both boys smack him upside the head in succession."

HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

 

We see CONNELL and MARIANNE facing each other in a classroom.

 

CONNELL

Aye, yer lookin' sad.

 

MARIANNE

I don't think I am.

 

CONNELL

Eh?

 

MARIANNE

Actually, I think I'm very normal.

 

CONNELL

Right ye are be, then.

 

MARIANNE folds her arms in a huff and glares at CONNELL.

 

MARIANNE

What are you, like, old enough to be in school, or old enough to be out of school?

 

CONNELL

I'm be lookin' Irish or Scottish now, that's very normal.

 

MARIANNE scoffs.

 

MARIANNE

You can't be normal! I'm normal!

 

CONNELL

I'll tell yer I'm just as normal as you!

 

MARIANNE

I am the most normal. I'm just regular, like bran flakes.

 

CONNELL

I go to this school too, ye know.

 

MARIANNE

And I am normal, I am a high school student. I do normal things.

 

CONNELL

Should we make out?

 

MARIANNE

If it is the consensus, in the syllabus in the library in the welcome room.

 

CONNELL

Eh?

 

MARIANNE stomps her foot and glares.

 

MARIANNE

What, I can't be weird? Do I always have to be normal? You men and your standards.

 

CONNELL

I am so hot for you, normal girl.

 

MARIANNE

And I can't wait to have your wet lips on me, normal boy.

 

CONNELL and MARIANNE embrace and kiss. Their kissing is exactly like everyone's first time in which it is sloppy with a lot of head movement.

 

CONNELL

(muffled)

God, you kiss so normal.

 

MARIANNE

(muffled)

If only you weren't a high school student, we could do normal things.

 

CONNELL's eyes fly open. MARIANNE opens her eyes wide.

 

CONNELL

Like what, eh?

 

MARIANNE

Oh my god! You don't understand me at all!

 

MARIANNE runs away with windmill arms. CONNELL runs after her, through a high school corridor.

 

CONNELL

Marianne! Mari - come back, eh, yer level-headed Irish or British woman! I love that you're normal!

 

MARIANNE stops slowly, and turns. She folds her arms.

 

MARIANNE

I don't want to be normal, Connell. I want to be unique.

 

CONNELL stares, struggling. MARIANNE scoffs, rolls her eyes and turns on her heel.

 

MARIANNE

Relationships are so hard."

As she is pursued by two very different men, she finds herself making a decision. Who will she end up with?That is up to the readers.",English,898,1/13,1,1,,3,"Chapter Text
Lilian stood with her brother amongst the crowd of the ballroom. Truth be told, she had desperately wanted to remain at home this evening. She had little interest for small talk and the painted smiles of the aristocracy. She had learned from her father  that they only displayed such friendliness when hoping to establish connections for themselves or to introduce their newly marriagable sons and daughters into polite society. Every hue of fabric could be seen in the room. While the men seemed almost exclusively to have chosen black, with the occasional splash of white, grey, brown or very rarely, colour, the women were an entirely different matter. Their gowns, each one adorned with lace or pearls or flowers, were in every shade imaginable.Lilian was no exception. She herself wore a dark, forest green ballgown with lace ruffles at the ends of her sleeves. Her forearms were exposed from just beneath the elbow, and her slim wrists were accentuated by simple pearl bracelets. Her skirt, puffed to ridiculous proportions by an ungodly amout of petticoats, had an elegant gather at one of her hips. The combination of the flaring skirt and tight corset around her waist gave her a most desirable figure, though withour her finery she was much different.When not forced into a corset and half a dozen petticoats, her figure was rather childish. Despite turning twenty three next month, her waist was not much to speak of, and her chest was, for want of a better word, lacking. She had a thin, small frame, and was not particularly tall either, though she was grateful that no one could mistake her for a child by height. But her air and manner of conversing spoke volumes on her grace and maturity. Her brother, Thaddeus, insisted she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen, but her answer was always the same. “Affection clouds your gaze, Brother.”She shared with Thaddeus the same porcelain skin, brown eyes, and bright red hair. However, where she was small and slim, he was tall, broad shouldered and the very depiction of a strapping young man. He was muscled, lean from hours of fencing and riding and to Lilian’s dismay, seemed to have more of a waist than she did. He had strong features and a dusting of stubble, with his long hair always kept neatly in a low ponytail by a length of black ribbon. How he managed to keep it from tangling as he tied it was a mystery to his sister, who struggled alongside her maid to get simple hairpins to remain in place without her curls grasping them tightly. To make matters more irritating; she shared those same tight curls with Thaddeus.“Are you not going to dance, Lily?” He asked. “I’d wager any man  here would jump at the chance to do so with you.” He grinned at her, his face a genuine picture of fondness. Lilian smiled softly herself upon hearing her nickname. As children, Thaddeus had likened her complexion to the lilies growing in the garden. Their pale petals reminding him of her almost white skin. She, of course had seen no such resemblance, but her brother was adamant, and had called her Lily frequently ever since, especially when he was in low spirits or unwell.“I find myself far more occupied with the time. I wish more dearly to go home more than anything, but to do so so quickly would be rude.” Lilian replied. She took a sip of champagne and sighed. “I do so hate social events.” She had never liked them. Even for her own birthday. Every year her parents threw a grand party for her. Every year she considered not attending. Thaddeus chuckled, amused. “With that attitude, little sister, you shall never find a husband.”Lilian huffed. “A woman can do a great deal more on her own now than she could before.” She told him. “What if I do not wish to find a husband?” Thaddeus gasped in a mockery of shock"". “Lily! Such heinous words!” He joked. Placing a gentle hand on her shoulder, he encouraged her softly. “Just one dance. One dance. With someone you deem acceptable.” He gestured to the veritable sea of potential partners. None caught Lilian’s eye. “I would rather not, Thaddeus.” She protested.“Excuse me.” Came a voice from behind them. They turned to find a young man, perhaps a year or so younger than Lilian standing there with an unreadable expression. “If you are wanting for a dance partner, I should like to  request the next with you.” Despite his words, he appeared less than overjoyed. Lilian responded with polite decorum. “Pardon me, Sir, but there are many women here who are wanting for a partner. They make no secret of it.” It was true. Throughout the great room, ladies were fanning themselves, giggling and adjusting their immaculate hair an clothes in hopes of attracting a partner. “I’m sure any would gladly take your hand.”The young man offered his hand all the same. “It is precisely because you do not flaunt yoursef so shamelessly that I wish to dance with you, Miss.” He had an accent, Irish perhaps, with sandy brown hair and stormy grey eyes. “Would you do me the honour of accompanying me in the coming set?”Choice 1: Take his handChoice 2: Reject his offer."

But all of that changed when he met Darth Malak, a male Sith Lord who had a way of making Obi-Wan feel things he had never felt before.Their first meeting was on the battlefield, as Obi-Wan led a group of Jedi against a Sith army. The battle was fierce, and Obi-Wan and Darth Malak found themselves facing off against each other in a one-on-one duel. Obi-Wan had always been a skilled warrior, but he was unprepared for the sheer power and ferocity of the Sith Lord. Despite his best efforts, Obi-Wan was defeated and captured.But instead of killing him, Darth Malak surprised Obi-Wan by offering him a proposition. ""Join me,"" he said, his deep voice sending shivers down Obi-Wan's spine. ""Together, we can rule the galaxy.""Obi-Wan was taken aback. He had never considered the idea of joining the Sith, let alone ruling the galaxy with one. But as he looked into Darth Malak's piercing blue eyes, he found himself drawn to him in a way he couldn't explain.Over the next few weeks, Obi-Wan found himself meeting with Darth Malak more and more frequently. They would discuss politics, philosophy, and the nature of the Force. Obi-Wan was surprised to find that despite their opposing views, he and the Sith Lord had much in common.As they spent more time together, Obi-Wan began to realize that he was developing feelings for Darth Malak. He tried to deny it at first, telling himself that it was just admiration for a worthy opponent. But as he saw the softer side of the Sith Lord, the way he cared for his troops and the people of his empire, Obi-Wan knew that it was something more.It wasn't long before Darth Malak realized that Obi-Wan was more than just a captive. He could sense the Jedi's growing affection for him, and began to return those feelings in kind. He would take Obi-Wan on long walks through the gardens of his palace, showing him the beauty of the Sith Empire and the wonders of the Force.Obi-Wan was torn. He knew that his feelings for Darth Malak were forbidden, that they went against everything he had been taught as a Jedi. But he couldn't help the way he felt, and the more time he spent with the Sith Lord, the more he realized that he wanted to be with him, to explore these new feelings and see where they might lead.It all came to a head one night, as Obi-Wan and Darth Malak sat together in the throne room of the Sith palace. They had been discussing the nature of good and evil, and how the lines between the light and dark sides of the Force were not as clear as they seemed.Darth Malak leaned in close to Obi-Wan, his breath hot on his neck. ""You know,"" he whispered, ""we could explore those lines together. We could find our own balance in the Force.""Obi-Wan's heart raced. He knew what Darth Malak was suggesting, and he wanted it more than anything. But he couldn't bring himself to betray the Jedi Order, to turn his back on everything he had ever known.In the end, Obi-Wan chose to remain true to his Jedi ideals. He thanked Darth Malak for his kindness and his hospitality, but said that he could not stay with him. Darth Malak was disappointed, but he respected Obi-Wan's decision, knowing that the Jedi had the strength and conviction to stay true to his beliefs.As Obi-Wan left the Sith palace and returned to the Jedi Temple, he couldn't help but feel a sense of longing and regret. He knew that he had made the right decision, but a part of him still yearned for the connection he had felt with Darth Malak.Over the years, Obi-Wan would think back on his time with the Sith Lord, and wonder what might have been if he had made a different choice. But he knew that he had made his decision, and that he had to live with the consequences.Despite the conflict within him, Obi-Wan remained devoted to the Jedi Order and the ideals it stood for. And though he never forgot the feelings he had shared with Darth Malak, he knew that his duty as a Jedi was to put those feelings aside and focus on his mission to serve the greater good of the galaxy."

It was only a few minutes later when they hear soft snoring coming from him.

They couldn’t pinpoint who it was, almost every girl desperately making eye contact with him, hoping it was her.He walked into the room, his hands full with a box. He passed girls left and right, paying no mind to their mutters, or cries of frustration and sadness. He heads all the way to the back where they were.They all looked at one another with wide eyes, before it widened even further as Seungcheol stopped by a blonde head. He reached out a hand and ran it through the blonde locks, from where they were sitting they can hear Jeonghan beginning to wake up.“Who is it?” Jeonghan mutters, rubbing his eyes and imagine his surprise when he sees Seungcheol standing in front of him.He bends down and gives Jeonghan a peck on the cheek.“Happy Valentine’s day babe.” He says, placing the gift on Jeonghan’s table. “I’ll see you later.”Jeonghan chuckles nervously as he feels the stares of his friends, all demanding an explanation. “Haha… surprise?…”"

We see a dark-haired girl and a blonde-haired girl facing each other in a gym. The dark-haired girl is glowering while the blonde-haired girl is clenching her fists.

Oh, I have so much feelings, this sucks!

 

BRUNETTE GIRL

You have to wing it! Do the dab!

 

The BLONDE GIRL screws up her eyes and stomps her foot.

 

BLONDE GIRL

No, Brunette Girl! I have to let it out! I have to sing - aaaaaaahhhh...

 

The BLONDE GIRL dramatically gestures.

 

BLONDE GIRL

No, I must dance!

 

The BLONDE GIRL goes into a beatbox rhythm. The BRUNETTE GIRL stares, with a wide open mouth.

 

BRUNETTE GIRL

That can't be healthy. Come take some drugs.

 

BLONDE GIRL

No!

 

BRUNETTE GIRL

They're herbal, by science.

 

The BLONDE and BRUNETTE GIRLS neck the drugs. They lay on the floor doing snow angels.

 

BLONDE GIRL

Everything is beautiful. I'm very young but tortured.

 

BRUNETTE GIRL

Harden up! But not how they did in the olden days. Harden up in the way that promotes self growth and diversity.

 

BLONDE GIRL

Yes!

 

The GYM DOOR opens and a chiseled, handsome TEEN GUY walks in.

 

TEEN GUY

I'm very ready to practice safe sex and be open about my feelings.

 

BLONDE GIRL

Oh my god, join us!

 

BRUNETTE GIRL

Yes, but I do wish teenagers looked like twenty-something year olds, like they used to in the olden days shows.

 

BLONDE GIRL

Pah! We have feelings and we are not afraid!

This reassured him, that even with the screams coming from the students being dragged to detention, that he'd rest peacefully.He felt sick, just watching this person, who fascinated him so.He wanted to explode in Augustus’ presence, he wanted to see his smile, and hear his cringe jokes, but of course, he slept…Mattholomule raised his hand in the boy's direction, finding itself in the outer layer of the tangles and curls of hair.He figured this would satisfy his unfulfilled desires.He let a finger wind itself in one of the coils, and then gently he pulled, letting it circle around and then off.Before he could go again, Augustus tensed.Mattholomule jumped back at the sound of his voice.""n~... no, stay."" Agustus muttered.""ma-...Matt…"" He continuedMattholomule brought himself close again to listen to the broken up sentences spoken from the still sleeping Gus.'Could he be…dreaming of me?'Mattholomule placed his hand once again on the other boy's head, inching closer, listening for confirmation.Mattholomule's body grew warm, his chest became heavy. His breathing was now uncontrollable as he distributed weight throughout his body, almost losing balance multiple times as he leaned furthermore over the table.And then he watched as the other boy's eyes slowly blinked open.In any other circumstance, Mattholomule would have been overrun with joy, pure bliss even, but not In this case.Anxiety grabbed his heart and pulled.He threw the hand that rested on his head up and brought it down with a firm chop.""WAke uP!"" Mattholomule almost yelled, with an unintentional squeak.Augustus sat back with his hands covering where Mattholomule had just struck.""I'm awake~"" Augustus whined.His face was scrunched, decorated with sleep and drool.Mattholomule acknowledged this, and then he acknowledged Augustus as a whole.He found himself giggling. Not just at Augustus, but the whole situation that occurred.It was a thrill.""What's funny?"" Augustus said, pointing his finger at the other boy.Mattholomule laughed harder at the fact that Gus could barely focus on him, seeing his finger and body drift, fighting his daze.""It's nothing, Augustus. You look like you lost a fight with a baby griffin."" He said, hiding his smile and giggles from him.Then he calmed himself, he took in the boy with his eyes. He let himself be taken over with the familiar comfort of his presence.And to himself, he said, 'I hope it was me.'"

Under the guise of celebration, she had not asked her attendants to water anything down, but she did not think they fell for it. Relius certainly hadn't, but he never fell for anything, so that was hardly a surprise. The Secretary of the Archives raised a brow at her. He was only halfway through his second glass, but he was not engaged to be married, so Irene suspected he had less to avoid contemplating. ""It is not too late to have him killed, you know,"" he offered. ""I could not pull it off. They are already expecting that of me, after what happened to my previous husband."" The words sounded strained to her ears, but she held her head high as he had taught her. He clicked his tongue thoughtfully. ""Trust me, Your Majesty. I could make it seem like an accident."" She shook her head. ""No, we have more civility than that, I would hope,"" but as soon as she heard it, she knew Relius would clock it as an excuse. It was an excuse, and a lazy one at that. Why could she not just admit it? Was the truth really such an awful thing? He had the grace not to call her out. ""He kidnapped you,"" was all he said. ""You know how Eddis loves her cousin, and they already think me a monster in the mountain country."" She paused to set her glass down, upright so that her attendants would know that it should be refilled. ""Some days, I doubt that my own people see me as a queen with much compassion. And can I blame them? I do not know when I lost my humanity, Relius."" She was rambling, saying more than was politically astute — things she often did when the two of them were drinking together. He narrowed his eyes. ""You never cared much for humanity before you met the Thief, Irene. I wonder if I will ever understand what changed."" The words were careful, more an offer than a question. She wondered if it was a reminder that he would listen, or more a promise that he would not repeat what he heard. Perhaps a bit of both. She held her tongue, watching with unnecessary care as one of the attendants refilled her glass. So focused was she that she did not even care to see who was doing it; she only watched with abundant interest. She then took a careful sip, her eyes turning back on Relius. He had been watching her with interest of his own. ""Is it such a crime to worry for my reputation?"" Relius set his cup down and stared at her, face contorted with suspicion. ""You want to marry him."" ""It does not m–"" He shook his head, baffled. ""No, Irene, you–"" ""He gives me hope,"" she said curtly. ""Some faith that perhaps the salvation of mankind is not as hopeless as it sometimes seems."" Something about this admission troubled Relius. Irene suspected it pertained to more than just the implication this had for international politics, as he seemed to be struck quite speechless — gaping at her like she suddenly had a full-grown pitneen perched on her head. ""A criminal gives you hope for the salvation of mankind? Irene."" Irene felt her cheeks flush. Yes, it did sound rather ridiculous when he put it like that, but it was still true. ""I think that I may love him, Relius."" ""May the Gods help us all, then."""

A question arises.,English,655,1/1,,,,13,"“Varré...” the Tarnished mumbled, glancing at the masked man sitting across from him. He was cooking some sort of meat over the fire for dinner, it seemed.“Hm?” Varré looked up from the meat to the other man with a curious stare.“...Why do you always wear your mask?” The Tarnished ever so bluntly questioned. He was acting on impulse, unlike his usual self.Varré seemed caught off guard by the forwardness of the question for a moment. The Tarnished usually never asked something so…straightforward to him. He chucked, “That’s for me to know and you to not, my lambkin. Though…” Varré trails off for a moment, “Ah, nevermind that.”The Tarnished didn't prod further, simply looking at the fire and mumbling something quietly to himself that Varré didn't quite hear.It goes on like that in silence for a while. The only sounds to be heard were the flames flickering near the cooking pot and the noises of unknown creatures in the far off distance.When the food is done, Varré hands over the food, gloved hand brushing the Tarnishes lightly. The Tarnished glanced away with a bit of red on his face, mumbling a small “Thank you” before nibbling a bit on the meat.There was another bit of silence as he ate and Varré watched, until Varré decided to speak up.“Do you want to see it?”The Tarnished choked a little on his food, coughing, “...See what?” He asked. He knew. He knew he did, but he wanted to be sure.“My face.”The Tarnished stared at the other man from across the dimming fire for a moment. Unable to speak, he hesitantly gave a nod.Varré got up and sat close to the Tarnished, the latter clenching his fists on his knees.“My lambkin, why are you nervous? Hm?” Varré said. A smirk in his voice could be heard as he looked down at the man's hands. The Tarnished couldn't get himself to respond.Varré chucked a little, and moved his hands to slowly slip off his mask. The Tarnished looked the whole time, heart feeling like it’d pop out of his chest. The Tarnished didn't know what to expect. But what he saw still made him feel like he was about to absolutely explode.Varré could be seen smiling at him, a genuine one, the Tarnished thought.  The Tarnished stared at the several features of him, to the mark on his head, his eyes, his scars, his mouth -“Everything you expected, eh?” Varré spoke up, gloved hand sliding up to cradle the other's face.“More so…” The Tarnished mumbled. He hesitates a moment, but slowly lets his hand fall on Varré’s face as well.“Now, my lambkin, may I ask something from you?” Varré spoke with a small grin on his face. He receives another nod.“May I kiss you?” Varré said, nearing his face to the Tarnished. Their foreheads had hit together, and the Tarnished replied, “...Please…please do.”Varré was quick to initiate the kiss, tilting his head with a smile as he did so. The Tarnished felt a rush of emotions as he kissed back, moving his arms to wrap them around the others chest.They stayed there for a minute, and then two, and three, before the Tarnished had to pull back to breathe properly. He felt shaken and lightheaded, the hammering of his heart louder than before.Varré guided him and the Tarnished’s faces away from each other, seemingly a little out of breath as well. He shuffled their positioning so they were back to sitting side by side, and felt the Tarnished lean into his shoulder.Varré would've had a quip by now, but he seemed as content with the situation just as the Tarnished next to him had been. He slowly begins to pet Tarnished’s head, running hair through his hand.The night passes by slowly as they stay like that."

Your disappearance scared Zhongli as memories of Guizhong came to mind. He didn't want to lose you too.,English,936,1/1,,,,17,"The air felt cold yet soothing as the battle ended. Adepti and humanity worked together and Osial was once more silenced. You soothed the hearts and wounds of the Millelith who fought alongside the Adepti and the Qixing. “Calm your heart, your efforts will surely be seen. Here, let me heal this for you.” you soothed, your words hushed yet comforting.To the eyes of the Millelith you were a goddess, a healer and fighter; a shield and a sword.Yet none could’ve thanked your efforts as you had disappeared into the darkness, while the golden eyes of a Yaksha stared at your fading figure. Hours passed since that battle occurred, and even more after the Gnosis was given to the Fatui. The moon settled amongst the stars yet their serenity couldn’t calm the heart of the ex-Geo Archon. His leg bounced and his hands fumbled, anxiety rushing through his heart “Y/n.. Where are you..?” he pondered to himself yet even amidst his anxiety, his livid emotions soon stilled like stagnant waters. He groaned as he sat up from his chair, leaving the tea paid. He held his hand as it trembled, yet his strides were nothing but confident.Even if his body showed confidence, his heart trembled in anxiety.Everything was anything but familiar to him as he searched, even his own weary breaths felt nothing like his. His breath continued to be frigid with his heart beating louder and louder in his ears, a siren-like scream he closely listened to. The rhythm of anxiety he made wailed at him as his feet walked on the solid rock of the floor.As though time never existed, his mind fell to the thought of Guizhong.The image of her curled body set in stone and still, fate sealing her away from her life. Breath still yet a tranquil face, oh how he longed to see the past. He longed too much for the past; for her presence.His breath was trained, his travel to his “death” was not something his body could lose breath to. With a blink of an eye, there you were. It was you; the hair, the clothes, the skin. It had to be you. His heart skipped, yet this mist — the air wasn’t clear. Afterall, a battle with the Osial isn’t really what you want for clear sights. His steps were slow, his dress shoes singing that satisfying clack.Clack, clack, clack.It was faster— he was faster.“Y/N!” Zhongli breathed. Finally, he felt something familiar. His arm stretched forward, a hand grabbing for dear life. His hand grabbed your shoulder rather harshly yet worry was evident just by the way he grabbed onto you; the way he leaned into you.“Zhongli? What are you—” “Where were you?!”His voice screamed, with an image of the past flashed in front of you. He used to be like this— seemingly stern as he waged war amongst many gods who were against him. Silence fell upon you two, the mist blurred everything but him. You couldn’t bear to look away from him, not now. His face was surprised, then an indescribable face was what he wore. His hand trembled against you, his whole body did.“Where were you, Y/n.” He demanded, his voice—that stern voice was something you thought you’d never hear again. You were used to this commander voice of his, it was something you heard at Guizhong’s death.“I was defending Liyue.” “Why.”You couldn’t breathe; the way he responded so quickly, the way he stood over you… His height was nothing helpful as even the moon shined behind him, bringing shadow over his face. Even his eyes—what once was comforting is now eerily watching your every move. “I can’t just stand and watch the people fight alone! What do you want me to do?! I’m not going to gamble on the possibility of survival—It’s Osial, Zhongli! Osial!” You defended against him, your hand dug onto his.“And? They clearly were able to handle it—You shouldn’t even be anywhere near the fight.”“Excuse me?” Your words spat out so quickly, even your thoughts couldn’t help but be surprised. Your eyes scrawled under Zhongli’s eyes. “You’re too important, Y/N.”“I’m not!”“Yes. You. Are.”“No!”An exhausted groan left Zhongli’s sour face, how could you be so stubborn?His other hand grabbed onto your cheek, it was a harsh clash—the feel of leather gloves against your scrunched cheek. “Why can’t you just let me do this for you, Guizhong?!” He screamed, your hearts shattering as it left him.In that moment, he knew he failed again; he failed you, again.His eyes that once were filled with rage were now soft with guilt. How could he do this to you, again? His lip was left agape, it trembled ever so slightly. He crumbled under your relaxed gaze—why would you even look at him like that? Your eyes were ever so solemn and so understanding, how? His body hunched forward, hiding his face as he looked at the floor. Such a bewildered face, filled with shame and regret. You sighed, bringing his angular frame closer to you in an embrace. “Y/n… I—” “It’s okay. You don’t need to say sorry for anything. Let this pass over you, it’s nothing you should be ashamed of.” Your hushed voice lulled him to comfort, just as you did with the Millelith soldiers. Rubbing his back, you soothed him as sweet nothings were delicately whispered to his ear. Words of comfort only for you two to share."

Peeking them, and when he realized about the situation, Intak make a quick move to pull Jiung's arm.""Jiung-hyung! It wasn't supposed to be like this!"" Intak yelled to the older who nearly gave Theo a fist, while Theo only covering his head with both of his hand. Jiung yelled back, but seeing Intak's worry eyes, he managed himself to stop and letting Intak pulled him wherever he go.Intak took him to their room then shut their door.""I know you like him but it wasn't suppose to be like this. You can't force someone feelings to like you back. That's not how it goes."" Intak spoke while Jiung only stared at his own toes. ""Hyung, you're not listeing.""""I am. Because you just don't understand how it feels.""Intak felt a bump on his chest. What did he just said? So for this two years he thought that Intak was standing there doing nothing? Intak definitely liking him quietly. He forced himself not to show it off that much—or even never. He stayed lowkey forever because he knew that Jiung wasn't there for him.""I understand. But when you like someone that never like you back, wasn't it better to let him go? He's better with Theo, right?""Jiung shuts his mouth.""Hyung, listen, i'm not acting like i knew everything or i'm a pro or something i'm just—it's actually hurt to see you suffer by yourself while others got really disturbed with what you did. Don't you feel it? Don't you miss how you laugh and how fun we spent when it's only us two? We don't care about love we just care about how happy we are. Don't you miss that time?""Jiung stared at Intak's eyes who were staring back at his.Jiung won't lie, he surely misses that time. How they laugh so loud till they can't stood up properly. How they waited for each other for each practices. How they knew each other so well. Jiung suddenly looked up. It's been two years since their debut, and he definitely leaving Intak behind. He felt guilty.""I miss it... actually."" Jiung murmured. Intak widen a smile, inviting Jiung to widen his smile too.""You have to found a way to stop liking Keeho-hyung. Maybe by liking me? Haha, kidding.""""If you want it, i'll try. Maybe it's worth than the previous.""""No-no-no-no, i mean like—""Jiung won't let Intak finishing his words. Jiung quickly pulled Intak to a big tight hug. Leaning his head on the younger’s taller shoulder. Scenting Intak's smell that was his favorite back then.""H-hyung?""""Hm?""""Two besties in a room. They might kiss?""""Haha, should we?""""Uugh... i guess? I kinda—ahm, you know—having, sort of, err... f-feelings? For, you?""Jiung laughed on how Intak stammered towards all his words. ""Why don't you tell.""""Because you only keep an eye on Keeho-hyung. I can't stole your attention from him. I'm jealous.""""Okay. From now on, i won't. I got you after all. Sorry,""""Don't apologize. You're doing fine. I love you.""""Oh wow, a sudden confidence? Well, i'm going to love you too. You'll see.""-fin"

Tweek was a nervous and jittery boy, who always had trouble sleeping at night. Craig, on the other hand, was a calm and collected boy, who always slept soundly through the night.One night, as Tweek lay awake in bed tossing and turning, Craig woke up and noticed his boyfriend's restlessness. He asked Tweek what was wrong, and Tweek admitted that he couldn't sleep because he was worried about the monsters under his bed.Craig knew just what to do. He got out of bed and took Tweek's hand, leading him to the window. He pointed up at the sky and said, ""Look at the stars, Tweek. See how they shine so bright? Those stars are like little guardians, protecting us from the monsters that might be lurking in the darkness.""Tweek's eyes widened as he listened to Craig's words. He realized that Craig was right, and that he didn't need to be scared anymore. Craig climbed back into bed and pulled Tweek close to him, holding him tightly. ""I'm always here to protect you, Tweek,"" Craig said softly. ""You never have to be afraid.""Feeling safe and loved in Craig's arms, Tweek finally drifted off to sleep. As he slept, he dreamed of a magical world where he and Craig were the bravest of knights, fighting monsters and saving the day.From that night on, Tweek was never afraid of the monsters under his bed again. He knew that with Craig by his side, he could face anything. And every night before they went to sleep, Craig would point out the stars in the sky, reminding Tweek that they were always watching over them.And so Tweek and Craig lived happily ever after, dreaming of adventures and love, and always falling asleep with a smile on their faces.

 I repeat that to myself. The lie that makes itself true.



 “I don’t need you anymore.”



 And there it is. Peace floats down from the deep blue sky one day, so gently that I don’t even notice. After months of waiting, wishing and wanting, something settles upon me and takes it all away. I don’t need you anymore. 



 And it feels good.


—

Leo stood under the shower, letting the water soak his thick fur and find its way down to the drain between his feet. Memories drift, back and forth, to the front of his mind; in front of his eyes, then back to his ears. Brown fur turned golden in the sunset. A gentle voice at his side, in the car, the dusty roadside, laughter, music. He takes a deep breath and inhales hot steam, remembering where he is. He emerges from the shower a minute later, wrapping himself in an enormous, clean towel. Laundry was the hardest at first. A feminine activity that he never got used to. He couldn’t help but feel pathetic as his clumsy folds resulted in wrinkles that no one else was there to see. He knew now the secret geometry of each article, and his frequent trips to Payton always result in those satisfying sideways glances he used to thrive on back in high school.

High school. It took him a while to understand why his friends hated it so much. To him, it was a whirlwind of youth and power, love and discovery. The star quarterback and the perfect boyfriend. Every day, something familiar danced with something new, and he was grown enough to see it. To savor it. And for a long time after it passed, he craved it. He shuddered now, remembering those days. Time spent in the past, he thought, was time wasted, as he finished toweling himself off and got dressed.

It wasn’t until recently that he came to this conclusion, but he wasn’t sure when exactly it happened. Day after day, he kept his mind off things. It seemed impossible once. How could the same life he always lived be enough now? And as long as he thought of it that way, it wasn’t. Slowly, at the urging of an old friend, he began trying new things. Tentatively, at first– A different dish at the diner, a different walk through town. Then, later, more things. Car shows, movies. Restaurants in Payton. He started college classes again. Business, this time, but he took some English electives as well. It was always one of his weakest subjects. His friends used plenty of big words, sure, but it was different on paper, where you couldn’t hear the tone of the person saying it, or look them in the eye and know what they meant because you knew their soul. 

Leo moved through the kitchen carefully, planning out his meal and his day, piece by piece. He’d try something new for lunch today, some recipe out of an anime that Jenna sent him. He was off work today. Should he catch a movie with Carl? Or go fishing with Flynn? What if he did something in Payton? Go to a bar, maybe? What if he met someone there? Should he take them home? Leo wrinkled his snout at the thought. Is that really what he wanted? 

The thought stopped him in place, an uncracked egg poised above the pan in his large, calloused hands.  What do I really want?  He never used to ask himself that question. He smiled then, finishing the motion and watching the egg’s insides lower themselves into the melted butter with a satisfying sizzle.

 I still wait for you. I don’t need you anymore, but I do.  

 My first love. My only love. How could I dream about anything else? 

 At night, it’s you. Floating down from the endless dark. I run outside as fast as my legs will let me, and I catch you. You fell, silly, from heaven, without a parachute. What were you thinking?  

 “I wasn’t falling,” you say, smiling up at me. I’m cradling you now, in my arms, and we’re in the house, on my couch, on my bed, somewhere. “I was just on my way down to see you. I knew you’d catch me. You always do.” 



 I wake up smiling. I’d never tell you this, but I leave my door unlocked now. You’d probably call me crazy, tell me “This isn’t the kind of town where that’s a good idea.” You always have something to say about the town, but the town is the last thing on my mind, otter.



 I’m waiting for you. One day, you’ll come to see me. In the middle of the night, maybe. You’ll walk on your toes so as not to wake me, because you still love the way I look when I’m sleeping, just like you used to say. You’ll climb into bed with me and fall asleep there, and I’ll get to wake up and see your face again. Just like before, only different. And I’m okay with that. You look different now, you act different now. I’m different too. Different is good. New is good. 



 You don’t have to come back. I’m okay now. But if you want to, I’m still here. We don’t have to “try it again.” We can be new. We can go anywhere. 



 Come softly. Don’t wake me. I’m having the most beautiful dream."
